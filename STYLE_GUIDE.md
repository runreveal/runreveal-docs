# Documentation Style Guide

This guide provides instructions for LLMs and contributors working on RunReveal documentation. It defines the tone, style, structure, and best practices to ensure consistency across all documentation pages.

## Intention & Purpose

### Primary Goals

1. **Clarity First**: Documentation should be immediately understandable. Users should be able to find what they need and understand it without confusion.

2. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what users can do and how to do it. Lead with practical examples and use cases.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with the simplest concepts and build complexity. Don't overwhelm users with advanced features upfront.

4. **User-Centric**: Write from the user's perspective. Use "you" and focus on their goals, not system internals.

5. **Completeness**: Provide enough context and examples that users can accomplish their tasks without needing additional support.

## Tone & Voice

### Core Principles

- **Professional but Approachable**: Be authoritative without being intimidating. Use technical terms when necessary, but explain them clearly.

- **Direct and Concise**: Get to the point quickly. Avoid unnecessary words or filler content. Every sentence should add value.

- **Helpful and Supportive**: Anticipate user questions and address them. Use encouraging language that builds confidence.

- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms throughout. For example, always say "investigation" not "case" or "incident" interchangeably.

### Voice Characteristics

**Do:**
- "You can create investigations to track security incidents."
- "RunReveal automatically indexes your logs for fast queries."
- "Use source-specific views for better query performance."

**Avoid:**
- "One might consider creating investigations..." (too passive)
- "The system will index logs..." (system-centric, not user-centric)
- "It is recommended that users..." (unnecessarily formal)

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure

- **Use active voice**: "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- **Keep sentences short**: Aim for 15-20 words per sentence when possible
- **Use parallel structure**: In lists, keep items grammatically consistent

### Word Choice

- **Prefer simple words**: "use" instead of "utilize", "help" instead of "facilitate"
- **Avoid jargon**: Explain technical terms on first use
- **Be specific**: "Click the 'Create Investigation' button" not "Click the button"

### Formatting Conventions

- **Bold for emphasis**: Use `**bold**` for important terms, UI elements, and key concepts
- **Code formatting**: Use backticks for:
  - Function names, parameters, and variables: `` `receivedAt` ``
  - UI elements: `` `Create Investigation` ``
  - File paths and commands: `` `/logs/search` ``
- **Headings**: Use descriptive headings that users can scan quickly

## Page Structure

### Standard Page Layout

1. **Title & Description**: Clear, searchable title and concise description
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview (1-2 sentences) explaining what the page covers
3. **Visual Elements**: Screenshots, diagrams, or videos when helpful
4. **Main Content**: Organized with clear headings (h2, h3, etc.)
5. **Examples**: Code examples, use cases, or step-by-step guides
6. **Related Documentation**: Links to related pages

### Heading Hierarchy

- **H1**: Page title (only one per page)
- **H2**: Major sections (e.g., "Getting Started", "Configuration")
- **H3**: Subsections within major sections
- **H4-H6**: Further subdivisions as needed

All headings should have descriptive, scannable text. Users should understand the section content from the heading alone.

**Note**: All h1-h6 headings in main content MUST have RunReveal purple bottom borders that gradually decrease in thickness:
- **H1**: 5px (thickest, most prominent)
- **H2**: 3.5px
- **H3**: 2.5px
- **H4**: 2px
- **H5**: 1.5px
- **H6**: 1px (thinnest)

All borders use the same RunReveal primary purple color (`#7c3aed`) with progressive opacity (95% for h1 down to 45% for h6). Headings that are links or inside cards/styled containers should NOT have borders.

## Content Guidelines

### Introductions

Start each page with a brief introduction that:
- Explains what the feature/concept is
- States why users might need it
- Sets expectations for what they'll learn

**Example:**
> "Investigations provide a centralized workspace for tracking security incidents within RunReveal. Each investigation collects related artifacts—queries, alerts, chat conversations, and notes—into a single timeline, enabling teams to collaborate on complex incidents and maintain a comprehensive audit trail."

### Examples

- **Always include examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Use realistic scenarios**: Examples should reflect real-world use cases
- **Provide complete examples**: Include full code blocks or complete workflows
- **Explain examples**: Don't assume readers understand why an example works

### Code Blocks

- **Include syntax highlighting**: Specify language (e.g., ` ```sql `)
- **Add context**: Explain what the code does before showing it
- **Use comments**: Add comments in code to explain complex parts
- **Show results when relevant**: Include expected output or results

**Important**: When using curly braces in JSX code tags (like `<code>`), escape them properly:
- Use HTML entities: `&#123;` for `{` and `&#125;` for `}`
- Or use template literals in JSX: `{`...`}` for code blocks inside JSX

### Lists

- **Use bullet points for**: Features, options, items without order
- **Use numbered lists for**: Steps in a process, ordered sequences
- **Keep items parallel**: All items should follow the same grammatical structure
- **Limit list length**: If a list has more than 7-10 items, consider grouping or using a table

### Tables

Use tables for:
- Comparing options or features
- Configuration parameters with descriptions
- API endpoints with methods and descriptions
- Structured data that benefits from columns

## Visual Design

### Using Tailwind CSS

When styling content with Tailwind:

- **Use branded colors**: Leverage the RunReveal color palette (primary, insight, vitality, etc.)
- **Maintain consistency**: Use similar styling patterns across pages
- **Responsive design**: Ensure content looks good on mobile and desktop
- **Dark mode support**: Always include dark mode variants

### Common Patterns

**Callout Boxes:**
```jsx
<Callout type="info">
**Note**: Use callouts for important information, warnings, or tips.
</Callout>
```

**Gradient Cards:**
```jsx
<div className="rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-light to-violet-100 dark:from-primary/20 dark:to-violet-900/20 p-6 ring-1 ring-inset ring-primary/30 dark:ring-primary/50">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

**Grid Layouts:**
```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
  {/* Cards */}
</div>
```

**Tabs Component:**
```jsx
<Tabs items={['Tab 1', 'Tab 2', 'Tab 3']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <div>
      {/* Content - use JSX lists, not markdown lists inside tabs */}
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Images

- **Use descriptive alt text**: All images should have meaningful alt text
- **Optimize file sizes**: Keep images under 500KB when possible
- **Use consistent naming**: Follow a pattern like `feature-name-1.png`
- **Place images strategically**: Put images near relevant content, not just at the top

## Technical Writing

### Procedures & Steps

When writing step-by-step instructions:

1. **Number each step**: Use numbered lists for sequential actions
2. **One action per step**: Don't combine multiple actions in one step
3. **Include expected results**: Tell users what they should see after each step
4. **Handle errors**: Mention common errors and how to resolve them

**Use the Steps component:**
```jsx
<Steps>
### 1) Navigate to Investigations
Go to **Investigations** in the sidebar and click **Open Investigation**.

### 2) Configure Investigation Details
Provide the following:
- **Title**: Descriptive name (required, 1-100 characters)
- **Description**: Context for what you're investigating
</Steps>
```

### API Documentation

When documenting APIs:

- **Show complete examples**: Include full request/response examples
- **Document all parameters**: List required and optional parameters
- **Include error cases**: Show what errors users might encounter
- **Provide curl examples**: Include command-line examples when relevant

### Configuration

When documenting configuration:

- **Show default values**: Always indicate what the default is
- **Explain options**: Don't just list options; explain when to use each
- **Provide examples**: Show complete configuration examples
- **Warn about breaking changes**: Clearly mark any settings that affect behavior significantly

## Common Patterns

### Feature Introductions

When introducing a new feature:

1. **What it is**: Brief description
2. **Why it matters**: Benefits and use cases
3. **How to use it**: Quick start or basic example
4. **Advanced usage**: Link to detailed documentation

### Troubleshooting Sections

When writing troubleshooting:

- **Organize by problem**: Group related issues together
- **Use clear headings**: "Cannot add artifact" not "Issue with artifacts"
- **Provide solutions**: Don't just describe problems
- **Include prevention**: Explain how to avoid the issue

**Use Tabs for troubleshooting:**
```jsx
<Tabs items={['Access Issues', 'Artifact Issues', 'UI Issues']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Problem description</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solution step 1</li>
        <li>Solution step 2</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Best Practices

When listing best practices:

- **Be specific**: "Use descriptive titles like '2024-01-15 Brute Force from IP Range 192.168.x.x'" not "Use good titles"
- **Explain why**: Help users understand the reasoning
- **Prioritize**: Put the most important practices first

## Accessibility

### Writing for All Users

- **Use plain language**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Provide alternatives**: Include text descriptions for visual content
- **Structure clearly**: Use proper heading hierarchy
- **Test readability**: Aim for 8th-10th grade reading level when possible

### Screen Readers

- **Descriptive links**: "Learn more about investigations" not "Click here"
- **Alt text**: All images need meaningful alt text
- **Table headers**: Use proper table markup with headers

## MDX-Specific Guidelines

### JSX in MDX

- **Escape curly braces**: In JSX code tags, use HTML entities (`&#123;`, `&#125;`) or template literals
- **Use JSX lists in components**: When using Tabs or other JSX components, use `<ul>` and `<li>` instead of markdown lists
- **Style props**: Use object syntax: `style={{property: 'value'}}` not string syntax
- **Boolean attributes**: Use camelCase: `allowFullScreen={true}` not `allowfullscreen="true"`

### Import Statements

Always import Nextra components at the top:
```jsx
import { Callout, Steps, Tabs } from 'nextra/components'
```
