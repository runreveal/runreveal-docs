# Detections

Detections currently are queries that execute on a schedule and their results
of all queries that are run are saved to our underlying database. You can view
the historic detection queries that have run on the RunReveal platform by
searching several underlying tables.
 - `scheduled_query_runs` - The results of all scheduled query runs, their
   execution times, the number of rows they returned, and parameter values
   that were passed to them.
 - `detections` - The rows that your detection queries return. These results
   contain the metadata of the associated detection, like risk score, mitre
   attacks, etc.

## Utilizing `scheduled_query_runs`
If you are curious if a query of yours is executing, failing, erroring, or
your parameters are being passed correctly, the scheduled_query_runs table
is exceptionally helpful.

For example, here's a way to look for errors that have occurred while
executing in a detection called 'ExampleQuery'.

```
select *
from scheduled_query_runs
where queryName='ExampleQuery' and error!='' and executionTime > now() - interval '1 day'
```

## Utilizing `detections`

The detections table is further subdivided into two views (that you can
interact) with like a tables.
 - `signals` - Detection queries that ran with the purpose of collecting data
   and have no notification channel configured.
 - `alerts` - Detection queries that ran and alerted one of your notification
    channels.

The detections table contains a row for each individual row returned by your
query. Fields returned by your query that match the column names of our defined
schema are saved directly into those columns in the detection table.

There is a limit of 100 rows that  acn be saved with the detection table. If
you need to exceed this limit for whatever reason, please contact us.

## Detection Data Model
The results of your detection queries are saved to the `detections` table. The
detections table contains several fields, along with their types.

- `id` - `String` - Unique identified of the run
- `scheduledRunID` - `String` - The unique identifier of the scheduled query run
- `workspaceID` - `String` - Your workspace ID
- `detectionID` - `String` - The identified of the detection
- `detectionName` - `String` - The name of the detection
- `recordsReturned` - `Int32` - The number of rows returned by the query
- `runTime` - `Int64` - The number of nanoseconds the query took to run
- `query` - `String` - The actual query that was run for the scheduled query
- `params` - `Map(String, String)` - The supplied parameters to the scheduled query
- `columnNames` - `Array(String)` - An ordered array of column names returned by the query
- `columnTypes` - `Array(String)` - An ordered array of the column types returned by the query
- `results` - `String` - An array of the first 100 returned values from the query
- `severity` - `String` - A string representing the severity of the alert
- `actor` - `Map(String, String)` - Details about the user that ran the query
- `resources` - `Array(String)` DEFAULT [] - Details about the resources returned from the query
- `srcIP` - `String` - Details about the srcIP in the log entries
- `dstIP` - `String` - Details about the dstIPs from the log entries
- `notificationNames` - `Array(String)` - The names of the notification channels
- `categories` - `Array(String)` DEFAULT [] - The categories that the query belongs to
- `mitreAttacks` - `Array(LowCardinality(String))` DEFAULT [] - The MITRE ATT&CK technique categories that the query belongs to


These tables can be accessed like any other table in RunReveal

To query the detection table:
```
select * from detections
```

To query the signals view:
```
select * from signals
```

To query the alerts view:
```
select * from alerts
```
