# Detection as Code
We want our customers to have the ability to represent their detection as code
for a variety of reasons.
 - Reviewing changes prior to deployment.
 - Easily provisioning config to multiple workspaces and environments.
 - Quick development of new configuration.
 - Rapid development and deployment.

Detection as code is facilitated through the RunReveal CLI. To get started
with detection as code, you'll need to download the CLI, and if you don't yet
have an active source with log data you'll likely want to create a log source
first.

There are a few major features that RunReveal supports in order to facilitate
our detection as code product.

1. [Getting Started With Detection as Code](/detections/detection-as-code/#getting-started-with-detection-as-code)
2. [Writing a detection](/detections/detection-as-code#creating-a-new-detection)
3. [Testing and linting detections](/detections/detection-as-code/uploading-detections#test-your-upload)
4. [Exporting your detections](/detections/detection-as-code/export-detections)
5. [Deplying from source control](/detections/detection-as-code/deployment)

## Getting Started with Detection As Code

Detection as code relies on the RunReveal CLI. Downloading the CLI can be done
through brew or from our github.

```
brew tap runreveal/runreveal
brew install runreveal
```

Next you'll need to log into RunReveal in the CLI. This command will opeen
a browser for you to complete your log in through.
```
runreveal init
```

## Detection Data Model
The detection data model is described as following. All fields are marked as
either optional or required. This file needs to be in either `yaml` format or
`json` format, either works.

```
# Required: The name of the query for reference
name: root_account_usage
 
# Optional: A display name that is shown in the UI
displayName: AWS Root Account Was Used
 
# Required: The name of the file containing the sql query
file: root_account_usage.sql
 
# Optional: A description of the detection.
description: Monitor for usage of the AWS root account.
 
# Optional: Additional notes that can be attached to the detection.
notes: |-
  This is a notes field that can store info about this detection.
  It can be useful to store links to playbooks in your other systems.
  
# Optional: An array of strings to help group queries
categories:
  - aws
  
# Optional: A severity string to identify the importance of the detection results.
severity: low
 
# Optional: An array of mitre attack framework classifications. 
# This is useful when identifying attack patterns.
mitreAttacks:
  - initial-access

# Optional: An array of mitre attack techniques classifications.
# This is useful when fine-graining the attack vector covered.
mitreTechniques:
  - T1659 
  
# Optional: An array of sources that this detection is used for.
# This can be useful to help identify which sources are lacking coverage.
sourceTypes:
  - cloudtrail
  
# Required: A cron string that identifies how often this detection will execute.
schedule: '*/15 * * * *'
 
# Optional (default: false): If true will disable this detection from running on its schedule
disabled: false
 
# Optional: Key/Value pairs that are replaced when the query executes. 
parameters:
  userAgent: AWS Internal
 
# Optional: An array of notification channel names that should receive an alert if this detection triggers
notificationNames:
  - email
  
# Optional: A notification template name to override the defualt channel template if this detection triggers.
notificationTemplate: aws_template
```

## Detection Time Windowing
One thing that many detection queries tend to do is query by looking back in
time and handling time windowing.

When writing a detection query it's best to write your query in a way that:
1. Uses `receivedAt` times for windowing of logs on short windows, not `eventTime`
2. Uses parameters `{from:DateTime}` and `{to:DateTime}` to ensure all logs are queried.

RunReveal allows you to specify parameters in your queries for dynamic values passed
in at query runtime. RunReveal will always pass `from` and `to` to your queries whether
they are specified or not.
 - `from` the end of the previous window that was queried.
 - `to` the current time, and the next `from` time.

In practice what this looks like, when writing a simple query that looks for the eventName
`example` your query would look something like this.

```
select * from logs
where eventName='example'
and receivedAt BETWEEN {from:DateTime} and {to:DateTime}
```

It's important not to use eventTime because many log sources deliver eventTimes in a delayed
manner, and eventTime is the timestamp provided by the log source. If you instead window
using `eventTime` it can cause messages to be missed in situations where log sources deliver
delayed data.

By querying `receivedAt` you ensure data is searched as it's received by the RunReveal platform
regardless of data delays from sources.

## Creating a new detection
If you'd like to save yourself from writing this yaml, the CLI can help you create the yaml
structure needed to create a new detection.

The `runreveal detections create` command will walk you through a wizard that will output
a yaml containing the structure you need to upload a detection to our api.
```
:) runreveal detections create
Detection name: my-detection
Description: example for the docs.
Categories (comma separated): aws, signal
Severity: Low
Risk Score (number): 10
ATT&CK classification: collection
Enabled: true
Query Type: sql


Detection Created:
        my-detection.yaml
        my-detection.sql

:) 
```
