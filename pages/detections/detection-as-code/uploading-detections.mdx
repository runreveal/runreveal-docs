# Uploading Detections
When it's time to upload detections, RunReveal's CLI is built specifically to
make this process simple and not error prone. The upload takes place through
our API.

## Test your upload

When you want to test to ensure that each detection is properly formatted and
see which detections have been updated, deleted, or created, the dry run flag
will show you exactly the information you want.

```
$ runreveal detections sync -d ~/detection-as-code --dry-run

 }                          
```

## Uploading
The only difference between uploading and performing a dryrun is the `--dry-run` flag.
Remove the `--dry-run` flag and your detections will be uploaded.

```
$ runreveal detections sync -d ~/detection-as-code
```

If you created a detection in the UI, and then attempt to upload your detection
from the CLI you will see an error message the first time you attempt to
overwrite your UI detection.

It will look a little something like this:
```
$ runreveal detections sync -d ~/detection-as-code --dry-run                                                            
processing '/Users/evan/detection-as-code/1password/1password-unusual-client.yaml'                                           
processing '/Users/evan/detection-as-code/cf-audit/anomalous-api-key-usage.yaml'                                             
processing '/Users/evan/detection-as-code/cf-audit/new-cloudflare-api-key.yaml'                                              
processing '/Users/evan/detection-as-code/cf-audit/user-added-removed-cloudflare.yaml
ERROR  This detection name is already in use, please choose a different name. If you're trying to upload your detections using detection as code, try the -o flag to overwrite existing detections created in the UI.
```

If you see this error, then adding the `-o` flag will overwrite the existing
detection and convert the detection from being `web` managed to being `cli`
managed.

## Force Uploading
If you receive an error because the detections are managed with the web interface
you'll need to run the following command to convert your detections to managed
by the CLI
```
$ runreveal detections sync -o -d ~/detection-as-code
```
