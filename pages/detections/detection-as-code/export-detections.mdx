# Export Detections

To get started or to adopt detection as code after already adding detections to
your account the RunReveal CLI has the commands necessary to bootstrap a code
repo from nothing, so you can 

Once you're logged into the CLI from the [getting started](/detections/detection-as-code/getting-started)
steps, you can utilize the export functionality to download all detection state
into a directory of your choosing.

```
:) runreveal detections export -d ~/detection-as-code
:) ls -l ~/detection-as-code 
total 0

These detections are categorized by sourceType and will be
sorted into directories by the `categories` tag if they
match the name of any `sourceType` within RunReveal.

After exporting each detection will be output into two files. The detection
query and the detection configuration and metadata.

Here's an example containing both the yaml and sql for our Okta detection of
a user reporting a suspicious action.

```
:) cat okta-user-suspicious-report.sql 
select * from okta_logs where
  eventType='user.account.report_suspicious_activity_by_enduser'
  and receivedAt > {from:DateTime} and receivedAt < {to:DateTime}%

:) cat okta-user-suspicious-report.yaml
name: okta-user-suspicious-report
displayName: Okta User Reported Suspicious Activity
description: Suspicious activity reported by end user
file: okta-user-suspicious-report.sql
categories:
- signal
- okta
sourceTypes:
- okta
schedule: "*/15 * * * *"
notificationNames: []
mitreAttacks:
- initial-access
severity: ""
riskScore: 0
```

## First time you export
The first time you export existing detections that were made in the web ui
you'll first need to upload them and force overwrite them from the CLI before
your CI/CD system can use them.

This step will force overwrite all detections that you have in the repo so
they will be managed via detection as code going forward.

```
$ runreveal detections sync -o -d ~/detection-as-code
```
