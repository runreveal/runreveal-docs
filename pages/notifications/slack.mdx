# Slack

To get started setting up your alerts you'll need to create a slack webhook app, and provide us with the webhook url to start receiving your alerts. Don't worry, this will only take a minute or two.

## Create Slack Application

1. Click [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new)
2. Click "Create New App" and "From Scratch"
3. Fill in a name like "RunReveal" and select the desired slack workspace
4. Under "Add features and functionality" select "Incoming Webhooks".
5. If necessary, select "Activate Incoming Webhooks"
