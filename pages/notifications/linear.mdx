# Linear

The Linear notification channel allows you to create Linear issues from RunReveal detections to streamline your security workflow.

## How It Works

The Linear notification channel creates Linear issues automatically when detections are triggered:

- **GraphQL API**: Uses Linear's GraphQL API to create issues
- **Team/Project Resolution**: Looks up team and project IDs by name
- **Label Management**: Resolves label names to IDs
- **Issue Creation**: Creates issues with specified priority and metadata

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create a Linear API Key

1. Open Linear in your browser
2. Go to [Settings → API → Personal API Keys](https://linear.app/runreveal/settings/account/security)
3. Click "Create Key"
4. Enter a name (e.g., "RunReveal Integration")
5. Select scopes:
   - **read** (to look up teams, projects, labels)
   - **write** (to create issues)
6. Click "Create"
7. Copy the API key (starts with `lin_api_...`)

### Step 2: Gather Linear Information

Before configuring in RunReveal, you need to know:

- **Team Name**: The Linear team where issues will be created
- **Project Name** (optional): The project within the team
- **Labels** (optional): Comma-separated list of labels to apply
- **Priority**: No priority, Urgent, High, Normal, Low

### Step 3: Configure in RunReveal

1. Go to [Notification Channels](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/notifications)
2. Click "Add Notification Channel"
3. Select "Linear"
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Display Name**: Security Issues (or your preferred name)
   - **Name**: security-issues (internal identifier)
   - **Team Name**: Enter the Linear team name (e.g., "Security Team")
   - **Project Name**: Enter the project name (e.g., "Security Alerts")
   - **Priority**: Select priority level
   - **Labels**: Enter comma-separated labels (e.g., "security, alert, automated")
   - **Linear API Key**: Paste the API key from Step 1
5. Click "Test Notification" to verify the connection
6. Click "Create Notification" to save

### Step 4: Add Notification Channels to Detections

Add notification channels to detections on individual notifications, within sigma rules, or mass subscribe via the detection query library tab of the detections page in RunReveal.

</Steps>

## Issue Format

Linear issues are created with:

- **Title**: "RunReveal Detection Alert"
- **Description**: Detection details including query information and result links
- **Team**: Specified team
- **Project**: Specified project (if provided)
- **Labels**: Specified labels (if provided)
- **Priority**: Specified priority level

You can create custom issue templates by going to [Notification Templates](/notifications/templates).

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions for teams and projects
- Set appropriate priority levels based on detection severity
- Use labels to categorize different types of alerts
- Regularly rotate API keys for security
- Test the integration before deploying to production
- Monitor issue creation through RunReveal's alert history
