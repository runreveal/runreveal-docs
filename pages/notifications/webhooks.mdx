# Webhooks

RunReveal will send HTTP POST request to a URL of your choosing along with the data that is associated with the detection.

Set this up using the Notification page in the RunReveal dashboard.

## Schema

The following shows the schema of the data that is sent in the webhook.

| Property | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title | string | The template title that was rendered. |
| message | string | The template body that was rendered. |
| query | scheduled query response | The field will be null if the notification was created from a trigger. Otherwise it will contain the data of the scheduled query. |

## Webhook Signing
Webhooks have a webhook secret that we use to sign the request body, along with a timestamp header we pass along with the notification.

The webhook integrity hash is calculated by concatenating the timestamp header and the HTTP request post body together, and calculating a SHAHMAC256 using the secret key
we provide to you. Make sure when calculating the hash that the hex string is treated as a byte array.

The HTTP Headers that we send along with all Webhook Notifications are described as:
 - `RunReveal-Timestamp` -- The timestamp in unix seconds that the webhook was generated.
 - `RunReveal-Integrity` -- The integrity hash that we calculated using our shared key.

Here is an example function that we've used, in Golang, to successfully verify the webhooks.
```
func SHAHMAC256(key, data []byte) (string, error) {
	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, key)
	_, err := mac.Write(data)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	hashBytes := mac.Sum(nil)
	base64Hash := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(hashBytes)
	return base64Hash, nil
}

func TestVerifySha256(t *testing.T) {
	var integrity = "3w7SmNuf5UHk9v0WV6IIACBx/dZazysTcU8fxowNQVI="
	var bodyPlusTime = `1720198139{"link":"https://runreveal.com/dash/detections/","message":"Yay! Your notification channel was tested successfully.","rawEvent":null,"test":{"status":true},"title":"RunReveal Notification Test"}`
	var key = "b0c374a4fbfec3ad6047495ca83b4df3d428ed100f51462683c96dcefd74998e"

	keyBytes, err := hex.DecodeString(key)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	base64Integrity, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(integrity)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	resultHash, err := SHAHMAC256(keyBytes, []byte(bodyPlusTime))
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	base64ResultHash, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(resultHash)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	itWorked := hmac.Equal(base64Integrity, base64ResultHash)
	if !itWorked {
		t.Fatal("Integrity check failed")
	}
}
```

Note, these signatures are calculated even for test notifications, so you can develop the code needed
to verify webhook signatures in a straightforward way.
