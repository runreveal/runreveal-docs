# Google Chat

The Google Chat notification channel allows you to send alerts to Google Chat spaces when detections are triggered.

## How It Works

The Google Chat notification channel uses webhook URLs to send messages to Google Chat spaces:

- **Webhook Integration**: Uses Google Chat's incoming webhook feature
- **Message Format**: Sends formatted messages with detection details
- **Threading**: Uses notification history ID as thread key for message grouping
- **Template System**: Uses Handlebars templates for message formatting

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create a Google Chat Webhook

1. Open Google Chat in your browser
2. Navigate to the space where you want to receive notifications
3. Click the space name at the top
4. Select "Apps & integrations"
5. Click "Add webhooks"
6. Enter a name for your webhook (e.g., "RunReveal Alerts")
7. Click "Save"
8. Copy the webhook URL (starts with `https://hooks.gchat.com/services/...`)

### Step 2: Configure in RunReveal

1. Go to [Notification Channels](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/notifications)
2. Click "Add Notification Channel"
3. Select "Google Chat"
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Display Name**: Security Alerts (or your preferred name)
   - **Name**: security-alerts (internal identifier)
   - **Google Chat Webhook URL**: Paste the webhook URL from Step 1
5. Click "Test Notification" to verify the connection
6. Click "Create Notification" to save

### Step 3: Add Notification Channels to Detections

Add notification channels to detections on individual notifications, within sigma rules, or mass subscribe via the detection query library tab of the detections page in RunReveal.

</Steps>

## Message Format

Google Chat notifications use Handlebars templates to format messages with detection details including:

- Detection name and description
- Risk score and severity
- Detection results and context
- Links back to RunReveal for detailed analysis

You can create custom message templates by going to [Notification Templates](/notifications/templates).

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive webhook names for easy identification
- Test notifications before deploying to production
- Consider using different webhooks for different severity levels
- Monitor notification delivery through RunReveal's alert history
