# Palo Alto Panorama Traffic logs

## Collecting logs in a bucket
Palo alto panorama traffic logs are loaded from S3.
You will need to forward your logs to a bucket prior to collecting them with RunReveal.

With`reveald` here is what a panorama config might look like to tail your syslog for panorama logs.

```
{
  "sources": {
      "hostlogs": {
        "type": "file",
        "path": "/var/log/syslog/",
        "extension": ".log",
      },
  },
  "destinations": {
      "runreveal-store": {
        "type": "s3",
        "bucketName": "runreveal-bucket",
        "bucketRegion": "us-west-2",
        "accessKeyID": "ACCESSKEY",
        "secretAccessKey": "SECRET"
      },
  },
}
```

## Setting up the source
You'll need to set up the rest of the source like a normal s3 source. This entails:
 1. [Creating an event notification](https://docs.runreveal.com/sources/s3-sources#event-notifications) with the directions listed here 
 2. [Creating an IAM role](https://docs.runreveal.com/sources/s3-sources#creating-the-role) so that RunReveal can access the objects in the bucket.
