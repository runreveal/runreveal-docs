# Bitwarden

Bitwarden logs provide comprehensive audit trails of password management activities, including user authentication events, password changes, vault access, and administrative actions. These logs are essential for security monitoring, compliance auditing, and detecting potential unauthorized access to sensitive credential data.

## Coming Soon
