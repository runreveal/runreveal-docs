# MongoDB

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service for MongoDB. Atlas logs provide information on database operations, such as query execution, connections, index usage, and performance metrics. They also capture events related to user activity, database configuration changes, and security incidents. These logs are essential for monitoring database health, optimizing query performance, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring data security and compliance.
