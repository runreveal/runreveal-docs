# HashiCorp Vault

Collect audit logs from your HashiCorp Vault instance, showing who accessed what secrets, when, and from where.

HashiCorp Vault audit logs can be ingested via S3 object storage.

## Ingest Methods

Setup the ingestion of this source using one of the following guides.

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_hashicorp_vault
```
</Callout>

## Setup

Configure your HashiCorp Vault instance to send audit logs to an S3 bucket.

1. Enable audit logging in your Vault configuration
2. Configure Vault to write audit logs to an S3 bucket
3. In RunReveal, create a new HashiCorp Vault source
4. Configure the S3 bucket connection

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a few minutes.

You can validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM runreveal.logs WHERE sourceType = 'hashicorp-vault' LIMIT 1
```
