# Lumos Audit Events

Lumos provides access management and governance capabilities with comprehensive audit logging for security and compliance monitoring. These logs capture information such as access requests, approvals, provisioning activities, and administrative events. They help administrators track user access patterns, detect unauthorized access attempts, and maintain compliance with access governance policies.
