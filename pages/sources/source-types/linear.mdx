# Linear Audit Logs

Linear audit logs provide a detailed record of workspace events over the last 90 days. These logs capture information such as account access, subscriptions, settings changes, user activities, and administrative actions. They help administrators track workspace activity, ensure security compliance, and audit changes for troubleshooting and incident investigation.

2. Go to **Workspace Settings** → **Administration** → **Audit Log**
3. Enable **Stream logs** to configure webhook streaming
