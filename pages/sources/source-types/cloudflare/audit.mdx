# Cloudflare Audit Logs

Cloudflare Audit logs allow you to view audit events from your Cloudflare account. Audit logs give insights into what resources were changed in your Cloudflare organization.

Cloudflare Audit logs will grab 30 days worth of logs for your account and backfill your source. After the initial load, RunReveal will attempt to poll the Cloudflare API to download your new audit logs every 60 seconds.


## Ingest Methods

Setup the ingestion of this source using one of the following guides.
- API Polling
- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/sources/object-storage/azure)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```

```
</Callout>
## API Polling Setup

The two fields we require from your Cloudflare account are your account identifier and an API token.

### Account Identifier

To find your account identifier,

1. Login to your Cloudflare account
2. Navigate to your organization's site settings
3. Your account identifier will be listed in the right hand panel near the bottom.
4. Click the copy button and paste it into RunReveal

### API Token

To generate an API token you can click the `Get your API token` link directly under the Account ID section. From there, create a new custom token.

Give the token a name like RunReveal to identify its use. The only permission the token requires is read access to `Account Settings`.
