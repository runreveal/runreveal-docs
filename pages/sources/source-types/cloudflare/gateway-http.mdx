# Cloudflare Gateway HTTP

Cloudflare Gateway HTTP logs capture details of HTTP and HTTPS requests made through Cloudflare's secure web gateway. These logs include information such as the URLs accessed, the IP addresses of the requestors, HTTP methods used, and the response codes. They are valuable for monitoring web traffic, enforcing security and content filtering policies, detecting malicious or suspicious activity, and ensuring compliance with organizational web usage policies.

## Setup

Setting up Cloudflare gateway HTTP logs requires the use of Cloudflare Logpush.

Once created Cloudflare will begin to push logs to your bucket and RunReveal will start to ingest them.
