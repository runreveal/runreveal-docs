## Setup

Setting up Cloudflare Gateway Network logs requires the use of Cloudflare Logpush.

Navigate to the Logpush setup page in your Cloudflare account and create a new logpush job that sends your access request logs to your storage bucket.

Once created Cloudflare will begin to push logs to your bucket and RunReveal will start to ingest them.
