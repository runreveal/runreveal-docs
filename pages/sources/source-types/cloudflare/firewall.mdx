# Cloudflare Firewall (WAF) Logs

Cloudflare Firewall logs provide detailed information about actions taken by Cloudflare's WAF on traffic to your services behind Cloudflare.

[These logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/firewall_events/) capture data such as the action the Cloudflare Firewall took on a request, the rule ID that was triggered, as well as client IPs, request URLs, response status codes, request method (GET, POST, etc.).

## Setup

Setting up Cloudflare Firewall logs requires the use of Cloudflare Logpush.

Navigate to the Logpush setup page in your Cloudflare account and create a new logpush job that sends your HTTP logs to your storage bucket.

Once created Cloudflare will begin to push logs to your bucket and RunReveal will start to ingest them.
