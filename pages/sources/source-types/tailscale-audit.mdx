Create a new OAuth Client under your Tailnet settings and provide it the
Audit Logs Read scope.

Once created, you'll be provided a `Client ID` and a `Client secret`. Paste these
into the RunReveal dashboard, along with the name of your tailnet, and we'll begin
collecting your tailscale logs immediately.
