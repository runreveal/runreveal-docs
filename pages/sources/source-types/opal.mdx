# Opal
Opal logs are sent to RunReveal via a webhook configured in your Opal Organization Settings.

# Setup
To setup your Opal source, start by creating the source in RunReveal to fetch
your WebhookURL that you'll configure in Opal. You'll be given a webhook after
creating the source via a popup.

In Opal under Organization Settings > Event Streaming, create a new Event
Streaming connection and enter your RunReveal WebhookURL, and configure
your authentication with your desired setting.

# Authentication
RunReveal supports authentication via Webhook HMAC from Opal. If you'd like
to use this method then the RunReveal source can be configured with an optional
HMAC auth setting.

> Note: If no HMAC secret is configured in RunReveal, authentication will not
be enforced.
