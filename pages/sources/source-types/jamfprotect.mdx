## Step 2: Create Data Endpoint Action in Jamf Protect Cloud

2. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Action Configurations**
3. Click **New** to create a new action configuration
4. Select **Data Endpoint** as the action type
5. Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "RunReveal Webhook")
6. Configure the data endpoint settings:
   - **Endpoint URL**: Paste the RunReveal webhook URL you copied earlier
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Headers**: Set Content-Type to application/json
   - **Authentication**: None (authentication handled via webhook URL)

## Step 3: Select Telemetry & Event Types to Forward

- In Jamf Protect, you can typically choose:
  - **Telemetry** (system, process, network, file events)
  - **Alerts** (detections, policy violations)
  - **Device status/events**
  - **User activity**
- You can always update your selection later as monitoring needs evolve.

## Step 4: Validate Delivery

1. Return to RunReveal, open your **Jamf Protect Source** page.
2. Confirm that logs are arriving.
3. Search within explorer or use Native AI Chat to inspect recent Jamf Protect events.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Logs**
  - Check that Jamf Protect webhook is enabled and pointed to RunReveal
  - Validate that events are generated in JAMF Protect Cloud and that you've selected your event types for the forwarder.
