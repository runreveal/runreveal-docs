# Teleport Cloud Audit Logs

These logs are emitted by Teleport Cloud to an S3 bucket and it's worth noting that the setup process
on the teleport cloud side is slightly unique compared to other providers. They will ask you to run
several commands in AWS Cloud Shell to instantiate a collection of teleport buckets.

## Ingest Methods

Setup the ingestion of this source using one of the following guides. 
If using the `AWS External Audit Storage` method for sending Teleport logs to AWS perform the necessary setup first before finishing the RunReveal ingestion steps.

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3.mdx)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3.mdx)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/sources/object-storage/azure.mdx)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs.mdx)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket, use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_teleport
```
</Callout>

## Setup

Teleport offers first party support for sending events to AWS. Otherwise you will need to setup your Teleport account to forward events to
your cloud storage account most likely using their [fluentd guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/management/export-audit-events/fluentd/).

### AWS External Audit Storage

At the end of the process you should be have a new bucket called something like:
```
xxxxxxxx-longterm-zzzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz
```

This is the bucket you'll provide RunReveal with access to.

Their docs are available [online](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/management/external-audit-storage/), but under Enroll New Integration, you'll need to set up a next 
AWS External Audit Storage integration.

As part of the setup process, you'll provide teleport with a name for your integration, the iam role
name you'd like for _teleport_ to create, the bucket name you'd like _teleport_ to create, and the bucket
prefix.

Once you provide these bits of information, you'll be given a Amazon CloudShell command to run. This will create
the role and the bucket within your AWS account. Once you provide teleport with your role's name, including the
AWS account ID.

Once you provide teleport with this information they will ask you to continue with the integration by running
an Amazon CloudShell command one final time to provision your buckets, and finally test the connection.
