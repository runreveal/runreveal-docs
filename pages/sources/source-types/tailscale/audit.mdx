# Tailscale Audit Logs

Tailscale Audit Logs provide a comprehensive record of administrative actions and user activities within a Tailscale network, capturing events such as user authentication, device connections and disconnections, policy changes, and administrative modifications. These logs are essential for security monitoring, compliance reporting, and understanding user behavior across your organization's Tailscale-managed network infrastructure.

## Ingest Method

This source uses am HTTP webhook to ingest events. Create the source in RunReveal and a new webhook URL will be generated. Use this URL when setting up your source.

create a Splunk streaming destination, and set RunReveal's webhook URL as your
webhook URL without any Token or API key.
