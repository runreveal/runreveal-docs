# Generic S3 Source

The Generic S3 source requires that you've done the following:
1. Created an s3 bucket that your logs streams to.
2. Provide RunReveal with access to a role 
3. Set up an event notification from your s3 bucket receiving logs that notifies RunReveal.

Additionally, the Generic S3 source has the special requirement that you can:

4. Provide transformation annotations to transform the event you receive, into a RunReveal event using the gjson syntax.

## Initial Setup
Consult the docs on setting up a role and how to provide RunReveal with access to that role on the [S3 Sources](/Sources/S3-Sources) page.

## Event Notifications
Ensure that your event notifications are being forwarded to this sns topic in your region.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_generic
```

## Dashboard setup
Create a Generic S3 source in the dashboard, and provide RunReveal with your bucket-name, IAM role name, and IAM external ID.

## Event transformation
Use this to remap columns from the logs table to different JSON properties in the rawLog.
Existing values will be overwritten by what is selected.
