# CloudTrail

<SourceTemplate />

The CloudTrail source requires that you've done the following:
1. Created an s3 bucket that cloudtrail streams to.
2. Provide RunReveal with access to a role 
3. Set up an event notification from your s3 bucket receiving CloudTrail logs that notifies RunReveal.

This source supports two different kinds of setups.

## Cloudformation Setup
If you don't yet have a trail setup, you'll need to either set up an Organization trail, or a non-organization trail. If you'd like RunReveal to create the trail, and fully set-up the the event notification, and access to the bucket, you can use these cloudformation templates.

RunReveal can help with this setup process using these two Cloudformation templates.
- [Organization Trail](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create?templateURL=https://runreveal-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/runreveal-cloudformation.yml&stackName=RunRevealSetup) (this will fail if you've not created an organization).
- [Non-organization Trail](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create?templateURL=https://runreveal-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/runreveal-cloudformation-noorg.yml&stackName=RunRevealSetupNoOrgs)

Once the cloudformation runs successfully, provide RunReveal with the name of the bucket, ensure the Role ARN is blank, and click "Connect".


## Manual Setup
Consult the docs on setting up a role and how to provide RunReveal with access to that role on the [S3 Sources](/Sources/S3-Sources) page.

### Event Notifications
Ensure that your event notifications are being forwarded to this sns topic in your region.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_cloudtrail
```

### Dashboard setup
Create a CloudTrail source in the dashboard, and provide RunReveal with your bucket-name, IAM role name, and IAM external ID.
