# JAMF

Your JAMF webhook information mostly shows locations that your devices have pinged from, and other kinds of management events.

## Ingest Methods

RunReveal offers the following ways to ingest JAMF Webhooks logs:

- [Webhook](#webhook)

## Webhook

JAMF Webhooks can send logs directly to RunReveal via webhook.

### Step 1: Create Webhook Source in RunReveal

![JAMF Webhooks Source](/jamf-source-2.png)

1. Go to [Sources](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/sources/add) in RunReveal
2. Click the **JAMF Webhooks** source tile 
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "JAMF Webhook")
4. Optionally enable bearer token authentication for added security
5. Click **Connect Source** to generate a unique webhook URL
6. Copy the generated webhook URL and bearer token (if enabled)

### Step 2: Configure Webhooks in Jamf Pro

1. Log into your Jamf Pro console
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the top navigation bar
3. In the left sidebar, under **Global Management**, click on **Webhooks**
4. Click the **+ New** button to create a new webhook
5. Fill out the webhook configuration form with the following details:
   - **Display Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your webhook (e.g., "RunReveal Webhook")
   - **Status**: Set to **Enabled**
   - **URL**: Paste the RunReveal webhook URL you copied from Step 1
   - **Authentication Type**: Choose the appropriate authentication method:
     - **None**: If you did not enable bearer token authentication in RunReveal
     - **Basic Authentication**: If your RunReveal webhook requires username/password authentication
   - **Content Type**: Select **application/json**
   - **Webhook Event**: Select the event type you want to trigger the webhook. **Note:** Each webhook in Jamf Pro can only be configured for one event type. If you need to capture multiple event types, you'll need to create separate webhooks for each event type and point them all to the same RunReveal webhook URL. For a complete list of available webhook events, see the [Jamf Pro Webhooks documentation](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/docs/webhooks-1).
6. Click **Save** to create the webhook

<Callout type="info">
**Multiple Event Types**: Since each Jamf Pro webhook can only handle one event type, create separate webhooks for each event you want to monitor (e.g., ComputerAdded, ComputerCheckIn, MobileDeviceEnrolled, etc.) and configure them all to use the same RunReveal webhook URL.
