# Backfill

Backfill allows you to ingest logs that you've already collected and stored in a blob storage container. This is useful for importing historical logs or migrating logs from another system. The backfill process can take some time depending on the volume of logs.

**Processing Time**: Backfilling large volumes of logs can take significant time. RunReveal will process all logs in the specified storage location, which may take hours or days depending on the amount of data.

## Ingest Methods

Setup the backfill using one of the following storage providers.

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/sources/object-storage/azure)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs)
- [Cloudflare R2 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/r2)
