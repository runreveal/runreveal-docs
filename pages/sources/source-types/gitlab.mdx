GitLab Audit Logs provide a detailed record of events and actions taken within a GitLab instance, 
helping organizations track changes for security and compliance purposes. 
The logs capture information such as user activity (e.g., login attempts, project changes, and group modifications), timestamps, 
and the specific actions performed, enabling administrators to monitor user behavior, investigate incidents, 
and ensure adherence to security policies.
