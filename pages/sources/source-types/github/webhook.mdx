# Github Webhook Events

GitHub Webhook events are automated notifications sent to a specified endpoint when certain actions occur in a repository or organization. 
These events capture activities such as push events, pull request creations or updates, issue comments, and release publications.

## Ingest Method

This source uses am HTTP webhook to ingest events. Create the [Github Webhook](https://runreveal.com/dash/sources/add/github-webhook) source in RunReveal and a new webhook URL will be generated. Use this URL when setting up your source.
