# Duo Security

Collect authentication logs from your Duo Security account to monitor user authentication events and multi-factor authentication activities.

Duo Security logs allow you to view authentication events from your Duo account. RunReveal will poll the Duo API to retrieve your authentication logs every 60 seconds.

## Setup

To setup your Duo Security source, you will need API credentials from your Duo account.

### Duo API Credentials

1. Log in to your Duo Admin Panel
2. Navigate to **Applications** and create a new **Admin API** application
3. Copy the **Integration Key**, **Secret Key**, and **API Hostname**
4. In RunReveal, create a new Duo Security source
5. Enter the credentials from step 3:
   - **Integration Key**: Your Duo integration key
   - **Secret Key**: Your Duo secret key
   - **API Hostname**: Your Duo API hostname (e.g., `api-xxxxx.duosecurity.com`)

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a minute.

You can validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM runreveal.logs WHERE sourceType = 'duo' LIMIT 1
```
