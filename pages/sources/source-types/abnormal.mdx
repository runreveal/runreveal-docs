## Overview

- **Source Type**: `rest_api_collector`
- **Ingest Method**: API Polling (every 60 seconds)
- **Data Collected**: Abnormal security events, threat detections, and user analytics

## Prerequisites

- Abnormal Security account with admin access
- Abnormal Security API access

## Step 1: Create an Abnormal Security API Key

### 1.1 Access Abnormal Security Console

1. Log into your [Abnormal Security Console](https://console.abnormalsecurity.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **"Create New API Key"**

### 1.2 Configure API Key Settings

1. **Key Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "RunReveal Integration")
2. **Description**: Add a description for your API key
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the key has the following permissions:
   - `events:read` - Read security events
   - `threats:read` - Read threat detection data
   - `users:read` - Read user analytics data

### 1.3 Generate API Key

1. Click **"Generate API Key"**
2. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately as it won't be shown again
3. Store the API key securely for use in RunReveal configuration

## Step 2: Configure RunReveal

### 2.1 Create REST API Collector Source in RunReveal

1. Log into your RunReveal dashboard
2. Navigate to **Sources** → **Add Source**
3. Select **"REST API Collector"** from the source list
4. Choose **"Polling"** as the ingest type

### 2.2 Configure Source Settings

Fill in the following fields:

**Settings:**
- **Unique ID**: Enter a unique identifier for this source (e.g., `abnormal-security-001`)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.abnormalsecurity.com/v1/events`
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Headers**: 
  - `Authorization`: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `Accept`: `application/json`

### 2.3 Test the Configuration

1. Click **"Verify Settings"** to test the connection
2. If successful, you should see a green checkmark
3. If there are errors, check:
   - API key is correct and has proper permissions
   - Abnormal Security account is active
   - Network connectivity to Abnormal Security API

## Step 3: Monitor and Verify

### 3.1 Check Data Ingestion

1. After saving your REST API collector source, wait 5-10 minutes
2. Go to **Logs** in your RunReveal dashboard
3. Filter by **Source Type**: `rest_api_collector`
4. You should see Abnormal security events appearing

### 3.2 Verify Event Types

The Abnormal integration collects the following types of events:

- **Email Threats**: Phishing attempts, malware, and suspicious email activity
- **User Behavior**: Anomalous user behavior patterns and risk indicators
- **Security Incidents**: Security events and incident reports
- **Threat Intelligence**: Threat detection and analysis data
- **Policy Violations**: Email policy violations and security rule breaches

### 3.3 Check for Errors

1. Go to **Sources** → **Errors** in RunReveal
2. Look for any REST API collector errors
3. Common issues:
   - Invalid API key or endpoint
   - Insufficient permissions
   - Rate limiting
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Incorrect headers or authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid API Key or Endpoint"
- Verify the API key is correct and hasn't expired
- Ensure the API endpoint URL is correct: `https://api.abnormalsecurity.com/v1/events`
- Check that the Authorization header includes "Bearer " before your API key
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters

#### 2. "Insufficient Permissions"
- Ensure your API key has the `events:read`, `threats:read`, and `users:read` permissions
- Verify your Abnormal Security account has admin access
- Check that the API key is active and not revoked

#### 3. "No Events Found"
- Verify that Abnormal Security is actively detecting threats
- Check that there's recent activity in your Abnormal Security console
- Ensure the source has been running for at least 10-15 minutes
- Test the API endpoint directly to ensure it returns data

#### 4. Rate Limiting
- Abnormal Security API has rate limits
- RunReveal polls every 60 seconds, which should be within limits
- If you hit rate limits, contact Abnormal Security support
