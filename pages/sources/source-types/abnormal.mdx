# Abnormal Security

Abnormal Security is a behavioral AI-based email security platform that learns the behavior of every identity in a cloud email environment and analyzes the risk of every event to block the most sophisticated attacks.

The Abnormal Security integration ingests threat data and case data identified by the Abnormal threat log and cases using the Abnormal Security API.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important Limitation**: Abnormal AI only allows for one API key per Integration tile. If you are using the Rest API Integration tile key for another integration you will need to reuse the same key.
</Callout>

## Ingest Method

This source is a polling source and will download new logs from the Abnormal Security API approximately every 60 seconds (1 minute). When first added, RunReveal will backfill available data from the last 14 days.

## Data Collected

The integration collects the following data types:

- **Audit Logs**: User actions and administrative activities from the Abnormal Security platform, including API calls, message actions, and platform usage events
- **Threat Logs**: Detailed information about detected email threats including attack types, strategies, sender details, remediation status, attachments, URLs, and threat metadata
- **Case Logs**: Security case data and incident information including case status, severity, affected employees, threat associations, analysis, and remediation details

## Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Abnormal Security Access Token

To set up the Abnormal Security integration, you need to obtain an access token from your Abnormal Security platform. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Abnormal Security platform](https://portal.abnormalsecurity.com/)
2. In the **Manage** section, click on **Settings**
3. In the **Settings** section, click on **Integrations**
4. Scroll down to the **Additional Integrations** section
5. Click **+ Connect** on the **Abnormal REST API** card to display an integration page for your organization
6. Copy and save the **Access token** - you'll need this for the RunReveal configuration

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Copy the access token immediately as it may not be shown again. Store it securely for use in RunReveal configuration.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Configure RunReveal

1. In the RunReveal dashboard, navigate to **Sources** → **Add Source**
2. Search for and select **Abnormal Security**
3. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your source
4. Paste the **Access Token** you copied from Abnormal Security
5. Click **Save** to create the source

RunReveal will begin collecting your Abnormal Security logs immediately and will poll the API every 60 seconds for new data.

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a few minutes.

You can check the `abnormal_logs` table in the Log Explorer to verify that logs are being ingested. You can also validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM abnormal_logs LIMIT 10
```

## Overview

- **Source Type**: `rest_api_collector`
- **Ingest Method**: API Polling (every 60 seconds)
- **Data Collected**: Abnormal security events, threat detections, and user analytics

## Prerequisites

- Abnormal Security account with admin access
- Abnormal Security API access

## Step 1: Create an Abnormal Security API Key

### 1.1 Access Abnormal Security Console

1. Log into your [Abnormal Security Console](https://portal.abnormalsecurity.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **"Create New API Key"**

### 1.2 Configure API Key Settings

1. **Key Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "RunReveal Integration")
2. **Description**: Add a description for your API key
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the key has the following permissions:
   - `events:read` - Read security events
   - `threats:read` - Read threat detection data
   - `users:read` - Read user analytics data

### 1.3 Generate API Key

1. Click **"Generate API Key"**
2. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately as it won't be shown again
3. Store the API key securely for use in RunReveal configuration

## Step 2: Configure RunReveal

### 2.1 Create REST API Collector Source in RunReveal

1. Log into your RunReveal dashboard
2. Navigate to **Sources** → **Add Source**
3. Select **"REST API Collector"** from the source list
4. Choose **"Polling"** as the ingest type

### 2.2 Configure Source Settings

Fill in the following fields:

**Settings:**
- **Unique ID**: Enter a unique identifier for this source (e.g., `abnormal-security-001`)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.abnormalsecurity.com/v1/events`
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Headers**: 
  - `Authorization`: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `Accept`: `application/json`

### 2.3 Test the Configuration

1. Click **"Verify Settings"** to test the connection
2. If successful, you should see a green checkmark
3. If there are errors, check:
   - API key is correct and has proper permissions
   - Abnormal Security account is active
   - Network connectivity to Abnormal Security API

## Step 3: Monitor and Verify

### 3.1 Check Data Ingestion

1. After saving your REST API collector source, wait 5-10 minutes
2. Go to **Logs** in your RunReveal dashboard
3. Filter by **Source Type**: `rest_api_collector`
4. You should see Abnormal security events appearing

### 3.2 Verify Event Types

The Abnormal integration collects the following types of events:

- **Email Threats**: Phishing attempts, malware, and suspicious email activity
- **User Behavior**: Anomalous user behavior patterns and risk indicators
- **Security Incidents**: Security events and incident reports
- **Threat Intelligence**: Threat detection and analysis data
- **Policy Violations**: Email policy violations and security rule breaches

### 3.3 Check for Errors

1. Go to **Sources** → **Errors** in RunReveal
2. Look for any REST API collector errors
3. Common issues:
   - Invalid API key or endpoint
   - Insufficient permissions
   - Rate limiting
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Incorrect headers or authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid API Key or Endpoint"
- Verify the API key is correct and hasn't expired
- Ensure the API endpoint URL is correct: `https://api.abnormalsecurity.com/v1/events`
- Check that the Authorization header includes "Bearer " before your API key
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters

#### 2. "Insufficient Permissions"
- Ensure your API key has the `events:read`, `threats:read`, and `users:read` permissions
- Verify your Abnormal Security account has admin access
- Check that the API key is active and not revoked

#### 3. "No Events Found"
- Verify that Abnormal Security is actively detecting threats
- Check that there's recent activity in your Abnormal Security console
- Ensure the source has been running for at least 10-15 minutes
- Test the API endpoint directly to ensure it returns data

#### 4. Rate Limiting
- Abnormal Security API has rate limits
- RunReveal polls every 60 seconds, which should be within limits
- If you hit rate limits, contact Abnormal Security support
