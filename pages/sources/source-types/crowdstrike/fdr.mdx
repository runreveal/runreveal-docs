# CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator
The CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator source is different than other S3 sources.
Instead of needing to configure your bucket, and a role, CrowdStrike provides all
of this configuration and information for you.

The information you'll need to provide from CrowdStrike is:
1. *AWS Access Key ID* - This is a normal AWS Access Key, and it's provided by CrowdStrike
   to authenticate to your CrowdStrike data.
2. *AWS Secret Access Key* - The secret key associated with your AWS Access Key ID.
3. *SQS Queue URL* - This queue URL provides RunReveal with notifications that new
   CrowdStrike data is available to be read.
4. *S3 URL* - The bucket that RunReveal will read your CrowdStrike data from.
5. *Region* - The region your S3 bucket calls home.

All of this information is required for the FDR source to work properly. Once provided
and the source is created, your CrowdStrike data should begin flowing to RunReveal
immediately.

## Querying your CrowdStrike Data
Your CrowdStrike data will be available in a few different places in RunReveal
 - `crowdstrike_aidmaster_logs` -- Basic host data collected from CrowdStrike.
 - `crowdstrike_data_logs` -- Contains raw data from your CrowdStrike sensors.
 - `crowdstrike_managed_logs` -- Information collected from managed assets.

 Additionally all CrowdStrike data is available in the `logs` table with
 the sourceType of `crowdstrike-fdr`.
