# Workday

Capture Workday activity logs detailing records of user actions, system events, and data changes within the Workday platform.

Workday stores logs for your account. When adding the Workday source, RunReveal will backfill your account with available logs. After the initial load, RunReveal will poll the Workday API to download your activity logs on a regular schedule.
