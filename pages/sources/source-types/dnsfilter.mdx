# DNSFilter

DNSFilter is a cloud-based DNS security and content filtering solution that protects against malware, phishing, and other web threats. DNSFilter logs provide information on DNS queries, including domain requests, categorization (e.g., malicious, safe, or blocked), and response actions. These logs help with monitoring web traffic, enforcing content filtering policies, and identifying potential security threats such as malicious domains or phishing attempts.
