# DNSFilter

The DNSFilter source requires that you've done the following:
1. Created an s3 bucket that dnsfilter streams it's logs to.
2. Provide RunReveal with access to a role 
3. Set up an event notification from your s3 bucket receiving DNSFilter logs that notifies RunReveal.

## Initial Setup
Consult the docs on setting up a role and how to provide RunReveal with access to that role on the [S3 Sources](/Sources/S3-Sources) page.

## Event Notifications
Ensure that your event notifications are being forwarded to this sns topic in your region.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_dnsfilter
```

## Dashboard setup
Create a DNSFilter source in the dashboard, and provide RunReveal with your bucket-name, IAM role name, and IAM external ID.
