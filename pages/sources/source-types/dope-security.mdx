# Dope Security

Dope Security is an endpoint protection platform that provides network security, file activity monitoring, and threat detection. Dope Security logs capture endpoint events including network traffic, file operations, process executions, and security policy violations. These logs help monitor endpoint security, detect threats, and investigate security incidents.

## Ingest Methods

RunReveal offers the following ways to ingest Dope Security logs:

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Webhook](#webhook)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_dope_security
```
Replace `<REGION>` with the AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`).
