# Authentik Audit Logs

Ingest authentik audit logs from a variety of sources.

Authentik supports multiple ingestion methods including S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloudflare R2.

## Ingest Methods

Setup the ingestion of this source using one of the following guides.

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/sources/object-storage/azure)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs)
- [Cloudflare R2 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/r2)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_authentik
```
</Callout>

## Setup

Authentik logs can be ingested via object storage. Configure your Authentik instance to export logs to one of the supported storage providers.

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a few minutes.

You can validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM runreveal.logs WHERE sourceType = 'authentik' LIMIT 1
```
