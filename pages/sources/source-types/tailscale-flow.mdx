# Tailscale Flow Logs
Tailscale flow logs are pushed via a webhook. Once you create the tailscale flow
source in RunReveal, your source will be assigned a webhook URL that's available
on the sources home page.

Once you're assigned a webhook URL, in Tailscale's Logs product, select "Network logs",
create a Splunk streaming destination, and set RunReveal's webhook URL as your
webhook URL without any Token or API key.
