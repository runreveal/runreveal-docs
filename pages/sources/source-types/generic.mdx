# Generic Log Sources

Generic log sources allow you to send any source logs to RunReveal. Whether you have custom application logs, system metrics, or third-party data, RunReveal can ingest and analyze it. Choose from multiple ingestion methods including cloud storage solutions and direct webhook integration.

<Callout type="info">
**Setup Guides**: For detailed setup instructions for each cloud storage source, see the links below, or use the instructions for setting up a generic webhook source to send logs to a webhook located on this page.
</Callout>

## Ingest Methods

RunReveal offers the following ways to ingest Generic log sources:

- [Azure Storage Account](/sources/object-storage/azure)
- [AWS S3](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs)
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)


<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_generic
```
</Callout>

## Webhooks

Webhooks are a simple way to send data to RunReveal. Just make an HTTP POST request with your JSON data.

### Setup

1. Go to [Sources](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/sources/add) in RunReveal
2. Click the **Webhook Generic Logs** source tile
3. Give it a name and click **Connect Source** to generic a unique webhook url and bearer token (if needed)
4. Copy your webhook URL which you'll use to send logs to as well as the bearer token you've set or generated (optional) 
### Testing with curl

Test your webhook with a simple curl command:

**With Bearer Token (Recommended):**
```bash copy
curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "User authentication successful",
    "user": "john@example.com",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100"
  }'
```

**Without Bearer Token:**
Edit your webhook source and delete the token field, then:
```bash copy
curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "level": "WARN",
    "message": "Authentication disabled",
    "service": "webhook-test"
  }'
```

### Viewing Your Data

Webhook data appears in the `logs` table with `sourceType = 'webhook'`. 

Go to the **Explore** tab and run:
```sql copy
SELECT * FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'webhook' 
ORDER BY receivedAt DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

### Example Log Data

You can send any JSON data you want. Here are some examples:

```bash copy
# User activity
curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": "john@example.com",
    "action": "login",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100"
  }'

# Application error
curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "level": "ERROR",
    "message": "Database connection failed",
    "service": "my-app",
    "error_code": "DB_CONN_ERROR"
  }'

# System status
curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "healthy",
    "cpu_usage": 45.2,
    "memory_usage": 67.8,
    "hostname": "web-server-01"
  }'
```

### Querying Your Data

Since webhook data is stored as JSON, use `JSONExtractString()` to get specific fields from the `rawLog` column:

```sql copy
-- Find all error messages
SELECT receivedAt, 
       sourceType,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'level') as level,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'message') as message,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'service') as service,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'error_code') as error_code,
       rawLog
FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'webhook' 
  AND JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'level') = 'ERROR'
ORDER BY receivedAt DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Find specific user actions
SELECT receivedAt, 
       sourceType,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'user') as user,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'action') as action,
       JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'ip') as ip,
       rawLog
FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'webhook' 
  AND JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'user') = 'john@example.com'
ORDER BY receivedAt DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Count events by level
SELECT 
  JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'level') as level,
  count() as count
FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'webhook' 
GROUP BY level
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
