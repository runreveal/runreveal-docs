# Generic Log Sources

Generic log sources allow you to send any type of event to RunReveal.

## Ingest Methods

RunReveal offers the following ways to ingest Generic log sources:

- [Azure Storage Account](/sources/source-types/generic/generic-azure)
- [AWS S3](/sources/source-types/generic/generic-s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3.mdx)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs.mdx)
- Webhooks


<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_generic
```
</Callout>

## Transform

Along with the standard setup for the source, you can also define which fields from your log match the RunReveal normalized schema.
Existing values will be overwritten by what is selected.

Access child objects using a `.` character or for a complete list of supported syntax visit [these docs](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).

Normalizing your logs will make it easier to detect across all of your sources.
