# Webflow Audit Logs

Collect audit logs from your Webflow workspace showing user access, content changes, and administrative events.

Webflow Audit logs allow you to view audit events from your Webflow workspace. RunReveal will poll the Webflow API to retrieve your audit logs every 60 seconds.

## Setup

To setup your Webflow Audit source, you will need API credentials from your Webflow account.

### Webflow API Credentials

1. Log in to your Webflow account
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** > **Integrations** > **API Access**
3. Generate an API token
4. In RunReveal, create a new Webflow Audit source
5. Enter your credentials:
   - **API Token**: Your Webflow API token
   - **Workspace ID**: Your Webflow workspace identifier

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a minute.

You can validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM runreveal.logs WHERE sourceType = 'webflow-audit' LIMIT 1
```
