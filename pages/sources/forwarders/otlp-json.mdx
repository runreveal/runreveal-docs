# OpenTelemetry (OTLP)

Ingest OpenTelemetry logs that have been uploaded to object storage as JSON.

OpenTelemetry logs can be ingested from various object storage providers including S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloudflare R2.

## Ingest Methods

Setup the ingestion of this source using one of the following guides.

- [AWS S3 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/s3)
- [AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS](/sources/object-storage/external-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/sources/object-storage/azure)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/sources/object-storage/gcs)
- [Cloudflare R2 Bucket](/sources/object-storage/r2)

<Callout type='info'>
If using an AWS S3 bucket use the following SNS topic ARN to send your bucket notifications.
```
arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:253602268883:runreveal_otlp_json
```
</Callout>

## Setup

Configure your OpenTelemetry collector or application to export logs to object storage in JSON format.

## Verify It's Working

Once added, the source logs should begin flowing within a few minutes.

You can validate we are receiving your logs by running the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM runreveal.logs WHERE sourceType = 'otlp-json' LIMIT 1
```
