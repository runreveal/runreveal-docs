# Forwarders

Choose your preferred log forwarding tool to send data to RunReveal using webhooks.

<Callout type="info">
**Before you begin**: Make sure you have created a webhook source in RunReveal. You'll need the webhook URL to configure your log forwarders.
</Callout>

## Choose Your Webhook Type

RunReveal supports two types of webhook sources, each with different use cases:

<Tabs items={["Structured Webhooks", "Generic Webhooks"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Structured Webhooks

Structured webhooks are designed for events that match RunReveal's normalized log format. This provides better parsing, filtering, and search capabilities.

**Best for:**
- Security events with known structure
- Events that can be normalized to RunReveal's format
- Applications that can format data according to RunReveal's schema

**Key Benefits:**
- Automatic field parsing and indexing
- Better search performance
- Structured query support
- Built-in field validation

**Data Format:**
```json
{
  "eventName": "UserLogin",
  "eventTime": "2023-11-11T13:47:58+00:00",
  "readOnly": false,
  "actor": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "id": "123456789",
    "username": "johndoe"
  },
  "src": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "port": 443
  },
  "service": {
    "name": "web-application"
  },
  "tags": {
    "environment": "production",
    "source": "auth-service"
  }
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Generic Webhooks

Generic webhooks accept any JSON format and store it as-is. This provides maximum flexibility but requires manual parsing for advanced queries.

**Best for:**
- Custom log formats
- Third-party integrations with unknown schemas
- Rapid prototyping and testing
- Legacy systems that can't be easily modified

**Key Benefits:**
- Accepts any JSON structure
- No schema requirements
- Maximum compatibility
- Quick setup for any data source

**Data Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-11-11T13:47:58+00:00",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "user_id": "123456789",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "custom_field": "any value you want"
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
