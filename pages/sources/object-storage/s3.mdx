# AWS S3 Bucket

An AWS S3 source works by saving logs to an S3 bucket and creating a put object notification that sends notifications to an SNS topic that RunReveal controls.
Each source has its own SNS topic that includes one for multiple different regions, reference the specific source documentation for the exact SNS topic to send to.

Once we receive this notification, RunReveal will download the S3 object and process the events.

## AWS Access Methods

When using the RunReveal controlled SNS topic we offer three separate authentication methods.

### RunReveal allow policy

Provide RunReveal IAM role access to read/list objects in your S3 bucket. Use the following policy to give access.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Allow-RunReveal-Read",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::253602268883:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom IAM role

S3 sources support reading via an IAM Role in your AWS account. This is so you don't need to worry about fiddling with a bucket policy each time you onboard a new log source.

At a high level you'll need to create a role and provide that role access to the data you want RunReveal to ingest.

#### Creating the role

When creating the role, you'll need to provide us with S3 and KMS permissions necessary to read objects from the bucket, and decrypt them.

When you create a source that supports AWS Role based access to the objects, you'll be prompted to provide a role ARN. Your role needs to have `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket`, and access to the `Resources` that are contained in your bucket.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:EXAMPLE_AWS_ACCOUNT:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  If your bucket objects are encrypted with an AWS managed AWS key, you don't need the KMS policy. 
  If it's encrypted with a KMS key you created that lives in your account, you'll need to include the KMS policy as well.
</Callout>

#### Secure Access Using External ID

The external ID configuration helps prevent the confused deputy problem. 
The trusted entities configuration necessary for RunReveal to access your account looks like this. 
Make sure you fill in the external ID with whatever you set up on your source.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::253602268883:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "<EXTERNAL_ID>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### AWS Access Key

Give an AWS user access to Read/List the S3 bucket with your logs in it. Generate a new AWS access key and provide RunReveal with the access key id and secret.

RunReveal will use the provided access key to authenticate access to your AWS account when reading S3 objects.

## Event Notification

Once RunReveal has access to the objects in your bucket, we will need to be notified when new objects are added to it.
Enable sending notifications to one of RunReveal's regional SNS topics by following along below.

1. Find the bucket containing the logs you wish to send to RunReveal.
2. From the bucket overview, click the "Properties" tab, then scroll down to "Event Notifications"
3. Click "Create Event Notification"
4. Give the configuration a name (for your own identifying purposes, doesn't matter what it is).
5. Select "All object create events" in the events section (photo below)

6. Then input RunReveal's S3 regional SNS topic ARN (`arn:aws:sns:<s3-bucket-region>:253602268883:runreveal_<sourcetype>`) under the "Destinations" block at the bottom like so.  
We've created a SNS topic in each region, 1 for each source type. If you run into issues, please contact us at `support@runreveal.com`.&#x20;

  For the exact SNS topic to use reference the documentation for that source.
</Callout>

## RunReveal Source Setup

Sources that allow you to use S3 to ingest logs will all have the same setup.
Navigate to the [Connect a source](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/sources/add) page and find the source you are adding.
Once open, select the `AWS S3 Bucket` ingest method and fill in the fields.

You will need the name of the bucket that the logs are stored in, currently RunReveal requires buckets to be unique across sources.
Depending on the authentication method selected supply the necessary role/external id, or access key/secret.

## Final Steps

At this point all of the pieces are in place for RunReveal to access logs stored in the bucket. 
Continue to the source docs for specific instructions on how to get your logs into the S3 bucket and the specific SNS topic to use.
