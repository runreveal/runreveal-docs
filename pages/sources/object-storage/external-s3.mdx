# AWS S3 Bucket with Custom SQS

An AWS S3 with custom SQS source works by saving logs to an S3 bucket and creating a put object notification that sends notifications to an SQS queue that you control.
RunReveal will subscribe to this queue, read the event notifications, access the listed bucket object, and read events from it.

This method is useful if you are already sending notifications to another SNS topic, adding your own SQS queue as a subscriber to that topic will allow you to fanout notifications to multiple subscribers.

## AWS Access Methods

Along with an S3 bucket where your events are stored, you will also need to create an SQS queue that new object notifications are forwarded to.
RunReveal will need to be given `ListBucket` & `GetObject` permissions on the S3 bucket(s) containing the logs and `ReceiveMessage` and `DeleteMessage` permissions on the SQS queue.

### Custom IAM role

S3 sources support reading via an IAM Role in your AWS account.

At a high level you'll need to create a role and provide that role access to the data you want RunReveal to ingest as well as the SQS queue that we should subscribe to.

#### Creating the role

When you create a source that supports AWS Role based access to the objects, you'll be prompted to provide a role ARN. 
Your role will need to have at least the following permissions, one for reading objects in your S3 bucket and a second for receiving and deleting messages in your SQS queue.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:<account-id>:<sqs-queue-name>"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:EXAMPLE_AWS_ACCOUNT:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  If your bucket objects are encrypted with an AWS managed AWS key, you don't need the KMS policy. 
  If it's encrypted with a KMS key you created that lives in your account, you'll need to include the KMS policy as well.
</Callout>

#### Secure Access Using External ID

The external ID configuration helps prevent the confused deputy problem. 
The trusted entities configuration necessary for RunReveal to access your account looks like this. 
Make sure you fill in the external ID with whatever you set up on your source.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::253602268883:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "<EXTERNAL_ID>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### AWS Access Key

Give an AWS user access to Read/List the S3 bucket with your logs in it. Generate a new AWS access key and provide RunReveal with the access key id and secret.

RunReveal will use the provided access key to authenticate access to your AWS account when reading S3 objects.

## Event Notification

Once RunReveal has access to the objects in your bucket and SQS queue, the queue will need to be notified when new objects are stored.
Enable sending notifications to your SQS queue either by sending to an SNS topic or directly to the queue.

1. Find the bucket containing the logs you wish to send to RunReveal.
2. From the bucket overview, click the "Properties" tab, then scroll down to "Event Notifications"
3. Click "Create Event Notification"
4. Give the configuration a name (for your own identifying purposes, doesn't matter what it is).
5. Select "All object create events" in the events section (photo below)

6. Then input the arn of the SQS queue or SNS topic that notifications will be sent to.

## RunReveal Source Setup

Sources that allow you to use S3 to ingest logs will all have the same setup.
Navigate to the [Connect a source](https://runreveal.com/dash/sources/add) page and find the source you are adding.
Once open, select the `AWS S3 Bucket with custom SQS` ingest method and fill in the fields.

![external s3 setup](/sources/external-s3-setup.png)

You will need the URL of the SQS queue that events are sent to and the region the queue was created in.
Depending on the authentication method selected supply the necessary role/external id or access key/secret.

## Final Steps

At this point all of the pieces are in place for RunReveal to access logs stored in the bucket. 
Continue to the source docs for specific instructions on how to get your logs into the S3 bucket.
