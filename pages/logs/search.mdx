## Overview

RunReveal's log explorer provides an improved experience for log analysis with better visibility, intuitive filtering, and AI-powered query assistance. The explorer makes all functionality discoverable and accessible on a single page.

### Key Features

The log explorer includes several key features:

- **Compact Layout**: Everything fits on one page - you can see log volume, filters, and results simultaneously without constant scrolling
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Table and column selection in a dedicated sidebar for better discoverability
- **Linkable Views**: Share exploration sessions with shareable URLs that preserve your exact configuration
- **Saved Queries**: Save queries with version history to iterate on ideas and track changes over time
- **AI Assistant**: Get help creating and updating queries using natural language prompts
- **Fixed Layout**: Optimized screen real estate with fixed-size components for consistent viewing

### Explorer Interface Layout

The explorer is organized into these key sections:

#### 1. Sidebar (Left)

The collapsible sidebar provides:

- **Table Browser**: Browse and select from available tables, views, and materialized views
  - Tables are organized by category (logs, source-specific views, custom views)
  - Expand tables to see their schema and available columns
  - Click a table to select it for querying
- **Column Selection**: When a table is selected, view all available columns with their data types
- **Toggle Button**: Collapse/expand the sidebar to maximize screen space

#### 2. Top Bar

The top bar contains:

- **Time Picker**: Select your time range for the query
- **Interval Selector**: Set the time bucket granularity for the histogram
- **Action Buttons**: 
  - **"Edit as Query"**: Switch to SQL mode and open the query in the query editor
  - **"Create Detection"**: Convert your exploration into a detection rule
  - **Share/Link**: Generate a shareable link to your current exploration state

#### 3. Filter Builder

The filter section allows you to:

- **Build Dynamic Filters**: Add filters using a visual builder with column autocomplete
- **Type-Aware Operators**: Operators adapt based on column data type (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
- **Multiple Conditions**: Add multiple filters that combine with AND logic
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on result values to quickly "Include in filter" or "Exclude from filter"

#### 4. Visualization

The time-series histogram:

- **Fixed Size**: Compact, horizontally-stretched chart that doesn't dominate the page
- **Click to Zoom**: Click and drag on the chart to select a time range and automatically update filters
- **Grouped Series**: When grouping by a column, see multiple colored series for comparison
- **Real-time Updates**: Chart updates automatically as you modify filters or time ranges

#### 5. Results Table

The results view:

- **Fixed Space**: Dedicated area for log results with proper scrolling
- **Sortable Columns**: Click column headers to sort results
- **Row Details**: Click rows to see full event details
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows query execution time and row count

### SQL Query Mode

When you click **"Edit as Query"**, the explorer switches to SQL mode:

- **SQL Editor**: Full-featured SQL editor with syntax highlighting
- **Same Layout**: Maintains the same page layout for consistency
- **Saved Queries Sidebar**: Access your saved queries from a collapsible drawer
- **Version History**: View and restore previous versions of saved queries
- **AI Assistant**: Get help writing and fixing SQL queries using natural language

### Saved Queries

The explorer includes a powerful saved queries system:

#### Creating Saved Queries

1. Write your query in SQL mode
2. Click **"Save"** in the top bar
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. The query is saved with all parameters and settings

#### Version History

Every time you save a query, a new version is created:

- **View History**: Click the version history icon to see all previous versions
- **Restore Versions**: Restore any previous version of a query
- **Track Changes**: See when each version was created and by whom
- **Automatic Versioning**: No need to manually version - every save creates a new version

#### Managing Saved Queries

- **Saved Queries Drawer**: Access all your saved queries from the sidebar
- **Search**: Search saved queries by name
- **Duplicate**: Create a copy of a saved query to iterate on
- **Delete**: Remove saved queries you no longer need
- **Edit Name**: Click the query name in the header to edit it inline (Google Docs-style)

### AI Assistant

The AI assistant helps you work with queries:

#### Using AI to Create Queries

1. Click the **AI Assistant** button in SQL mode
2. Describe what you want to query in natural language
3. The AI generates a SQL query based on your description
4. Review and refine the generated query

#### Fixing Query Errors

When a query has an error:

1. Click **"Fix with AI"** button
2. The AI analyzes the error and suggests a fix
3. Review the corrected query and apply it

#### Query Iteration

- **Refine Queries**: Ask the AI to modify existing queries
- **Add Filters**: Request additional filters or conditions
- **Optimize**: Ask for query optimization suggestions

### Linkable Exploration Views

Every exploration state can be shared via URL:

- **Shareable Links**: The URL contains all your settings (table, filters, time range)
- **Team Collaboration**: Share investigation links with team members
- **Documentation**: Bookmark specific exploration states for documentation
- **Context Preservation**: Links preserve your exact filter configuration

### Switching Between Modes

You can seamlessly switch between exploration modes:

- **Explorer → Query Editor**: Click "Edit as Query" to convert your exploration to SQL
- **Query Editor → Explorer**: Use the "Open in Explorer" option to view query results in explorer mode
- **State Preservation**: Your filters and settings are preserved when switching modes

### Best Practices

- **Start with Explorer**: Use the visual explorer for initial investigation
- **Switch to SQL**: Use "Edit as Query" when you need more complex queries
- **Save Frequently**: Save queries as you iterate to preserve your work
- **Use Version History**: Don't worry about breaking queries - you can always restore
- **Share Links**: Use shareable links to collaborate with your team
- **Leverage AI**: Use the AI assistant for query suggestions and error fixes

## Query Tips

Follow these tips to improve query performance and get faster results:

- **Use source-specific views**: Instead of querying the `logs` table, use source-specific views like `okta_logs`, `aws_cloudtrail_logs`, or `github_logs`. These views are optimized for their respective sources and can significantly improve query speed.

- **Filter by sourceType**: When querying the `logs` table, add a filter on `sourceType` to narrow down results to specific log sources. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

- **Use smaller time ranges**: Shorter time windows (e.g., 1 hour or 1 day) process faster than longer ranges (e.g., 30 days). Start with a smaller time range to test your query, then expand if needed.

- **Add specific filters early**: Apply filters on indexed fields (like `sourceType`, `sourceID`, or normalized fields) as early as possible in your query to reduce the dataset size before processing.

- **Limit result sets**: Use the LIMIT clause or set reasonable result limits to avoid processing and returning excessive amounts of data.

- **Use aggregations**: When possible, use aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.) instead of returning all individual events. Aggregations are more efficient for large datasets.
