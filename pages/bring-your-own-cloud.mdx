# Bring your own cloud
RunReveal supports a Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) model. This means that you can
use your own cloud provider to store your log data, run our product within your
VPC, and configure our product so it works to your liking.

There's a variety of reasons you might want to do this including:
 - Increased security and compliance posture
 - Reduced latency and cost
 - Increased control over your data

# Setup

To get started with BYOC, you'll need to reach out to us and we can help you
configure everything but there are a few important guides you'll need.
