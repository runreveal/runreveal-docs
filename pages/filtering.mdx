# Filtering
RunReveal supports log filtering as a first class feature of the product. The current supported
methods are:
- Regular Expression Filtering

## Regex Filtering
To filter with a regular expression, click to add a new filter.

The _pattern_ is the regular expression that we will match on. By default, all filter rules will
drop any log that matches the pattern. For example, consider the following log:
```
{"user":"evan", "event":"login", "ip":"1.1.1.1"}
```

Specifiying this pattern will cause the log to be dropped.
```
user
```

### Flags
We support the following regular expression flags. *DO NOT* add these flags to your pattern.
Instead add filter flags using the Filter Flags checkbox toggles.
 - **i** - Case Insensitivity - Ignore case when matching.
