# Auth0

The Auth0 source is a webhook based source that uses their log stream feature.

To get started, create an auth0 source in the dashboard. The source should have a webhook URL and a Bearer Token that is
available in the sources list.

## Auth0 Configuration

Under monitoring > streams, create a new Custom Webhook log stream. Set the webhook URL to the `api.runreveal.com` URL
provided in your auth0 source, and in Auth0 set the Bearer token value to the entirity of the bearer token string provided by
runrevela. This should include the word `Bearer`. Your bearer token string should look something like `Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

Finally, ensure that the stream is configured as a JSON Array and click save after ensuring that all events are being sent.
