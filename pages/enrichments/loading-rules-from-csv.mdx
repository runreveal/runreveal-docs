# Loading Rules From CSV

If you are creating an enrichment with many rules, you may find it more convenient to load your rule definitions from a CSV instead of
manually creating each rule in the UI.  To do so, you should prepare a CSV with:

* Exactly 3 columns
* Comma delimited
* Double quoted values.  Escaping of double quotes within values can be done with double double quotes (`""`)

where each row is an enrichment rule of the form:

```
match_type,pattern,data
```

Where:

* `match_type` is one of `exact`, `regex`, or `cidr`
* `pattern` is the pattern to match for this rule
* `data` is a JSON object with the data to be added to log events matching this enrichment rule.  `data` is furthermore restricted to string
keys and values, with no nested objects.

Some valid rule examples:

```
"exact","alice@example.com","{""user_id"":""12345""}"
"regex","\.org^","{""email_tld"":""org""}"
"cidr","10.0.0.0/16","{""location"":""san francisco""}"
```


On the create/edit enrichment page, in the `Rules` section, you will find a `Load from file` button.

On successfully loading your rules, you will see the table below populated.  If you are happy with the results, you can click `Create Enrichment` (or `Update Enrichment` if this is an update) to enable your new rules.
