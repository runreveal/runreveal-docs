# Network Connectivity and IP Whitelisting

Some integrations require IP allowlisting or firewall rules to permit outbound connections from RunReveal. This page provides the IP addresses you'll need to whitelist for integrations that use IP-based access controls.

## RunReveal Outbound IP Addresses

All outbound traffic from RunReveal originates from the following IP addresses:

- `18.190.118.65`
- `18.221.211.67`
- `18.221.220.90`

<Callout type="info">
These IP addresses are static and do not change. If you need to verify these IPs or have questions about network connectivity, contact RunReveal support.

## When IP Whitelisting is Required

IP whitelisting is typically required for integrations that:

- Use IP-based network policies (e.g., Snowflake, some database integrations)
- Have firewall rules that restrict inbound connections
- Require allowlisting of specific source IPs for API access
- Use network security groups or access control lists (ACLs)

## Common Integration Use Cases

### Snowflake

If your Snowflake account has IP allowlisting enabled, add RunReveal's IP addresses to your Snowflake network policy. See the [Snowflake integration guide](/sources/source-types/snowflake) for detailed setup instructions.

### Database Integrations

For database integrations that require IP whitelisting, add all three IP addresses to your database's allowed IP list or firewall rules.

### API Integrations with IP Restrictions

Some API integrations may have IP-based access controls. Whitelist all three IP addresses to ensure reliable connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing connection issues with an integration that requires IP whitelisting:

1. Verify all three IP addresses are whitelisted in your network policy
2. Check that firewall rules allow outbound connections from these IPs
3. Ensure network security groups or ACLs permit traffic from these IPs
4. Review integration-specific documentation for additional network requirements
