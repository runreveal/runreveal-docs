# Configuring Role Based Access Control

RunReveal supports Role Based Access Control for subjects accessing resources in your workspace.

We have configured a set of default roles to simplify the management of permissions assignment to users through those roles.

Each resource has 3 permissions defined: Read, Edit and Delete.  Read allows read-only access to the class of resources including listing the instances of that resource.  Edit allows for creation and updating that resources attributes and metadata.  Deletion is required to remove a resource record from the database.

The following roles have been defined for workspaces: `admin`, `analyst`, `operator` and `cibot`.  Below you will see their permissions enumerated.

| Permission          | Description                           | Admin | Analyst | Operator | CIBot |
