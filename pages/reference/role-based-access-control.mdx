# Configuring Role Based Access Control

RunReveal supports Role Based Access Control for subjects accessing resources in your workspace.

We have configured a set of default roles to simplify the management of permissions assignment to users through those roles.

Each resource has permissions defined for Read and Edit actions. Read allows read-only access to the class of resources including listing the instances of that resource. Edit allows for creation, updating, and deletion of resources (delete is included in edit permissions).

The following roles have been defined for workspaces: `admin`, `analyst`, `operator` and `cibot`.  Below you will see their permissions enumerated.
