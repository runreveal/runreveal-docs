# Using the CLI
## Install the CLI
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for macOS, then enable our homebrew tap and install the CLI:

```
brew tap runreveal/runreveal
brew install runreveal
```

## Login to RunReveal

Once RunReveal has enabled your domain on the platform, login with:

```
runreveal init
```

The `init` command is used to both create an account or log in to an existing account. If it is your first time running init, you'll be prompted to enter the name of your workspace.

```
runreveal init
Enter your workspace name: Example Inc.
```

You can validate that you're logged in by running the following command

```
runreveal config account

üëç You're logged in!
User ID: 2KUOdUOFyuTbPD7amU3WidyfOzf
User Email: evan@runreveal.com
```

Now you're ready to search your logs like a pro and manage your RunReveal account from the terminal!

## Environment Variables
RunReveal CLI uses environment variables to set up specific aspects of the CLI configuration. These are helpful
if you don't want to run `runreveal init`, configure your active workspace, proxy the CLI through a local proxy, or
any number of use cases.

### RUNREVEAL_TOKEN
The `RUNREVEAL_TOKEN` environment variable is used to authenticate your CLI session. It supplants the need to run `runreveal init`
and it will override the token stored in your keychain or the RunReveal configuration file.

### RUNREVEAL_WORKSPACE
This environment variable is used to set the active workspace for your CLI session. It will override the workspace ID
if one is set in the RunReveal configuration file or keychain. This ID _must_ be a workspace ID, not the name of your
workspace.

### RUNREVEAL_BASEURL
For customers who have deployed the RunReveal API on-prem or in a private cloud, you can set the `RUNREVEAL_BASEURL`
environment variable to point the CLI to your RunReveal API instance.

```
export RUNREVEAL_BASEURL=https://api.runreveal.com
```

### RUNREVEAL_DEBUG
The `RUNREVEAL_DEBUG` environment variable is used to enable debug logging for the CLI. This is helpful if you're
troubleshooting an issue or want to see more information about the requests and responses from the RunReveal API.

This will output the HTTP requests that are being sent to the RunReveal API.

```
export RUNREVEAL_DEBUG=1
```

### RUNREVEAL_HEADER_FILE
This is a file that contains additional headers that should be sent along with all HTTP requests that the CLI makes.
This is helpful if you're using a proxy or need to send additional headers for authentication.

```
export RUNREVEAL_HEADER_FILE=/path/to/headers.json
```

The structure of the header file is a JSON object in this format:
```
{
    "Headers": {
        "Custom-Header": "value",
        "Another-Header": "value"
    }
}
```
