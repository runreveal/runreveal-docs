# RunReveal Audit Logs

RunReveal automatically creates audit logs for all API operations and user activities in your workspace. These logs help you track who did what, when, and from where for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting.

## What Are Audit Logs?

Every action taken in RunReveal—creating sources, running queries, updating settings, viewing data—is automatically logged. These audit logs are stored in the `runreveal_audit_logs` view and are accessible through your normal log queries.

## Flags

Audit logs include several boolean flags that provide important metadata about each operation:

### Read-Only Flag (`readOnly`)

The `readOnly` flag indicates whether an operation modified data or just retrieved information:

- **`readOnly = true`**: The operation only retrieved or viewed information without modifying data
  - Examples: Viewing lists, running queries, reading configurations, checking status
- **`readOnly = false`**: The operation created, updated, or deleted data
  - Examples: Creating sources, updating detections, deleting resources, modifying settings

**Note**: Some operations use POST requests for technical reasons (large payloads, complex queries) but are still read-only. RunReveal automatically marks these correctly based on the operation type.

### Error Flag (`responseError`)

The `responseError` flag indicates whether the operation completed successfully:

- **`responseError = false`**: The operation completed successfully
- **`responseError = true`**: The operation failed, with details available in `responseErrorMessage`

This flag helps identify failed operations in your audit logs for troubleshooting and security monitoring.

## Data Retention

Audit logs follow the same retention rules as your other logs, check the TTL column on the logs column to see the retention period for your plan.
