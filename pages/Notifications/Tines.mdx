# Tines
We support Tines as a destination so our customers can trigger
different SOAR workflows. 

Create a Tines webhook to receive a notification event from RunReveal. Note the webhook URL and the secret.

Provide the RunReveal Tines notification with the Webhook URL, followed by the secret in the following format. You can read the Tines documentation about this [here](https://www.tines.com/docs/actions/types/webhook#authentication)

```
https://tenant.tines.com/webhook/<path>/<secret>
```

In RunReveal, click "Test Notifcation" to be sure that in Tines the secret was not rejected.
