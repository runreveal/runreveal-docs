# runreveal v2025.5.12 Release Notes

🐛 **Bug Fix: Improved CrowdstrikeFDR Parsing**

This release enhances the CrowdstrikeFDR parser with better error handling and type conversion:

- Parsing errors are now properly passed upstream instead of being silently skipped
- Added a new StringOrInt type to handle fields that can be either strings or integers
- Basic event metadata is preserved even when parsing fails, ensuring better error tracking

These improvements will lead to more reliable data processing and easier troubleshooting for CrowdstrikeFDR events.
