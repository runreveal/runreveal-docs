# runreveal Nightly Build ðŸŒ™

ðŸš€ **Streamlined Build Process**

This nightly build focuses on improving our build infrastructure:

- Updated goreleaser configuration to depend only on private build
- Fixed personal access token reference

These changes enhance our development workflow and ensure smoother builds. While not directly user-facing, they contribute to the overall stability and efficiency of the project.

## Changelog

- goreleaser: update to only depend on private build (#1203)
