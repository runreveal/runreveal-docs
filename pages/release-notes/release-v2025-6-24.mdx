üêõ **Bug Fix: Improved GitHub Logs Actor Extraction**

This release addresses an issue with extracting actor information from GitHub logs. The update prioritizes the use of "user" and "user_id" fields over "actor" and "actor_id" fields when available, ensuring more accurate actor identification across various GitHub events.

### Changes:
- Fixed actor extraction in GitHub logs to handle events using different field names for user information
- Updated GitHub polling source to align with recent object storage changes

This enhancement improves the reliability of actor information retrieval in GitHub log processing.
