# RunReveal Onboarding Guide

RunReveal is a modern security data platform built on ClickHouse that eliminates traditional SIEM complexity while delivering detection-as-code, AI-powered investigations, and sub-second query performance at scale. This guide walks you through setting up your workspace, connecting data sources, configuring detections, and getting your team productive with RunReveal.

## Initial Setup

<Steps>

### Create Your Account

Navigate to [app.runreveal.com](https://app.runreveal.com) and create your account:

1. Click **Sign Up** and enter your email address
2. Check your email for the verification link
3. Complete account setup with your name and company information

Your workspace is automatically created with default settings:
- Workspace name: `your-email's Workspace`
- Admin role: Automatically assigned
- Default email notifications: Pre-configured

### Verify Workspace Setup

**Verify workspace configuration**:

1. Go to **Settings → Workspace Settings** in your dashboard
2. Check workspace name and admin role
3. Note your workspace ID for CLI usage (Optional)

Expected workspace structure:
- Admin access enabled
- Default notification channel active
- API tokens available under **Settings → API Tokens**

**Verify notification channels**:

1. Go to **Notification Channels** in your dashboard
2. Confirm default email channel is active
3. Test notification delivery

Default email notifications include:
- Detection alerts
- System health notifications
- Source connection status

**Generate API token for CLI access (Optional)**:

1. Go to **Settings → API Tokens**
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Name: "CLI Access"
4. Copy token for later use

Store your API token securely - you'll need it for:
- RunReveal CLI operations
- CI/CD integrations
- API-based automation

### Invite Team Members

<Callout type="info">
RunReveal supports four role types: Admin (full access), Analyst (detection management), Operator (query and reporting), and CIBot (CI/CD automation).
</Callout>

Invite team members through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Workspace Members**
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Enter email address and select appropriate role
4. Click **Send Invitation**

Invited users receive an email with signup instructions. You'll see their status update from "Pending" to "Active" once they accept.

**Role Capabilities**:

| Role | Detections | Sources | Workspace Settings | Query Access |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Analyst | ✓ | Read-only | Read-only | ✓ |
| Operator | Read-only | Read-only | Read-only | ✓ |
| CIBot | ✓ | Read-only | Read-only | ✓ |

</Steps>

## Connect Your First Source

<Callout type="tip">
Start with Okta, AWS CloudTrail, or GitHub - these are the easiest integrations to configure and provide immediate security value.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Choose Integration Type

RunReveal supports three primary ingestion methods:

- **API Polling**: Okta, GitHub, Office 365
- **Object Storage**: S3, R2, GCS, Azure Blob
- **Webhooks**: Vector, Fluent Bit, custom

### Configure Okta Integration

**Get Okta API Token**:

1. Log into Okta Admin Console
2. Navigate to **Security → API → Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Name: `RunReveal Integration`
5. Copy the token (starts with `SSWS-`)

<Callout type="warning">
Store your Okta API token securely - it won't be shown again after creation.
</Callout>

**Configure in RunReveal**:

1. Go to **Sources** in your dashboard
2. Click **Add Source → Okta**
3. Enter configuration:
   - Domain: `company.okta.com`
   - API Token: Your SSWS token
   - Log Types: System logs, User events, Authentication events
4. Click **Test Connection**
5. Click **Save**

Expected result: Logs start flowing within 60-120 seconds.

**Verify Data Flow**:

```sql
-- Check for Okta logs
SELECT 
  eventName,
  COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'okta'
  AND receivedAt > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
GROUP BY eventName
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

Navigate to **Sources → Okta → Recent Events** to view live log data.

### Configure AWS CloudTrail

**Deploy CloudFormation Stack**:

1. Use RunReveal's pre-built template from the AWS Console
2. Stack name: `RunRevealSetup`
3. Parameters: Accept defaults
4. Capabilities: Acknowledge IAM resource creation
5. Wait for stack creation (2-3 minutes)

<Callout type="info">
The CloudFormation template creates an S3 bucket, enables CloudTrail logging, and configures cross-account access for RunReveal.
</Callout>

**Add Source in RunReveal**:

1. Go to **Sources → Add Source → AWS CloudTrail**
2. Enter configuration:
   - S3 Bucket: Your CloudTrail bucket name
   - Region: Your AWS region
   - Role ARN: (leave blank for CloudFormation setup)
3. Click **Save**

**Verify CloudTrail logs**:

```sql
-- Check for AWS CloudTrail events
SELECT 
  eventName,
  userIdentity.type,
  COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM logs 
WHERE sourceType = 'aws-cloudtrail'
  AND receivedAt > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY eventName, userIdentity.type
ORDER BY event_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Configure Generic Webhook

<Callout type="tip">
Use webhooks for custom applications, Vector, Fluent Bit, or any log source that can POST JSON via HTTP.
</Callout>

**Create Webhook Source**:

1. Go to **Sources → Add Source → Webhook**
2. Configure webhook name and description
3. Copy your webhook URL

<Callout type="warning">
Protect your webhook URL - it provides write access to your RunReveal workspace.
</Callout>

**Test Webhook**:

Send test event using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_SOURCE_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "timestamp": "'$(date -Iseconds)'",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "Test webhook log",
    "service": "test-app"
  }'
```

**Verify in RunReveal**:

```sql
-- Check for webhook logs
SELECT *
FROM logs
WHERE sourceType = 'generic-webhook'
  AND receivedAt > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
ORDER BY receivedAt DESC
LIMIT 10
```

</Steps>

## Configure Detections

<Callout type="info">
Detections continuously monitor your logs for security events. Create detections as SQL queries or Sigma rules, then configure notification channels for alerts.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create Your First Detection

```

**Query**:

```sql
SELECT 
  actor.email as user,
  src.ip as source_ip,
  COUNT(*) as failed_attempts,
  MIN(receivedAt) as first_attempt,
  MAX(receivedAt) as last_attempt
FROM logs 
WHERE eventName = 'user.session.start'
  AND outcome.result = 'FAILURE'
  AND receivedAt BETWEEN {from:DateTime} AND {to:DateTime}
GROUP BY actor.email, src.ip
HAVING failed_attempts >= 5
ORDER BY failed_attempts DESC
```

### Configure Notification Channels

**Set Up Slack Integration**:
