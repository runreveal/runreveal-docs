# Quick Start Guide: Detections, Signals, and Alerts 

This guide walks you through RunReveal's detection system using hands-on examples. We will go over adding a webhook to send test logs to via curl to test detections and see how **Detections**, **Signals**, and **Alerts** work together.

**Detections**, **Signals**, and **Alerts** are all classified as detection results and are part of the Detections table. **Signals** are detection results without notifications (for analysis/tuning). **Alerts** are detection results that trigger notifications.

|  | Detections | Signals | Alerts |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|
| **What it is** | Automated rules that analyze logs | Detection results without notifications | Detection results with notifications |
| **Purpose** | Continuous monitoring and analysis | Pattern recognition and tuning | Immediate awareness and response |
| **Filtering** | `detections` table | `signals` table | `alerts` table |
| **Notifications** | None | None | Email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc. |
| **Use Case** | Security policy enforcement | Threat hunting and analysis | Incident response workflows |

## Getting Started

This guide walks you through the complete workflow for setting up detections, signals, and alerts in RunReveal:

1. **Create Webhook Source** - Set up a data source to receive test events (Either a Structured Webhook or Generic Webhook Source in UI)
2. **Send Test Data** - Generate sample security events for testing
3. **Create Detection Rule** - Build a SQL-based detection that analyzes your data
4. **Trigger and Review** - Manually run the detection and check results
5. **Compare Signal vs Alert** - Convert to alerts and see the difference

<Steps>

### **Step 1: Create Webhook Source**

First, create a webhook source in RunReveal to receive test data:

1. **In RunReveal UI:**
   - Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
   - Click **Connect a new source**
   - Select **Webhook** from the source types
   - Configure the webhook:
     - **Name**: `test-webhook-source`
     - **Description**: `Test webhook for detection guide`
   - Click **Create** or **Save**
   - **Copy the webhook URL** - it will look like: `https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID`

![Step 1: Create Webhook Source](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-webhook.png)

### **Step 2: Send Test Data**

Now send a test security event using your webhook URL:

1. **Test Event:**
   ```bash copy
   curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/30pw8Fynw5W7PzjbnRyxnfMsID2 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
       "source": "test-system",
       "eventName": "suspicious_login",
       "severity": "high",
       "user": "test-user",
       "srcIP": "192.168.1.100",
       "action": "login_attempt",
       "result": "success",
       "user_agent": "curl-test",
       "metadata": {
         "login_method": "ssh",
         "session_id": "test-123"
       }
     }'
   ```

2. **Verify ingestion to logs table:**
   ```sql copy
   SELECT receivedAt, 
          sourceType,
          JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'eventName') as eventName,
          JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'user') as user,
          JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'srcIP') as srcIP,
          rawLog
   FROM logs 
   WHERE sourceType = 'structured-webhook'
     AND JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'eventName') = 'suspicious_login'
   ORDER BY receivedAt DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   ![Step 2: Send Test Data](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-1.png)

### **Step 3: Create a Test Detection Rule**

Create a SQL detection that will trigger a signal from your test logs:

1. **In RunReveal UI:**
   - Go to **Detections** > **Create Detection**
   - **Name**: `test-suspicious-login`
   - **Type**: **SQL**
   - **Query**:
   ```sql copy
   SELECT 
     JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'eventName') as eventName,
     JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'user') as user,
     JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'srcIP') as srcIP,
     JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'user_agent') as user_agent,
     JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'severity') as severity,
     receivedAt
   FROM logs 
   WHERE sourceType = 'structured-webhook'
     AND JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'eventName') = 'suspicious_login'
     AND JSONExtractString(rawLog, 'srcIP') = '192.168.1.100'
     AND receivedAt BETWEEN {from:DateTime} AND {to:DateTime}
   ```
   - **Schedule**: `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
   - **Severity**: **Medium**
   - **Categories**: `["authentication", "test"]`
   - **Save** (Signal will be generated as a notification channel was not configured)

   ![Step 3: Create a Test Detection Rule](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-2.png)

### **Step 4: Trigger and Review Detection**

1. **Manual Execution:**
   - Navigate to **Detections** 
   - Find your `test-suspicious-login` detection
   - Click **Run Detection** to execute it manually
   - Wait a few seconds for execution to complete which will generate a signal

2. **Check signals view:**
   ```sql copy
   SELECT detectionName,
          severity,
          recordsReturned,
          categories,
          receivedAt
   FROM signals
   WHERE detectionName = 'test-suspicious-login'
   ORDER BY receivedAt DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   ![Step 4: Trigger and Review Detection](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-4.png)

### **Step 5: Compare Signal vs Alert**

Now convert your detection to an alert:

1. **Add notification channel:**
   - First, add a **[Notification Channel](/notifications/getting-started)** (email, Slack, etc.) in RunReveal UI

2. **Edit detection:**
   - Edit `test-suspicious-login` detection
   - Attach the notification channel to the detection
   - **Save** changes

3. **Send another test event:**
   ```bash copy
   curl -X POST https://api.runreveal.com/sources/hook/30pw8Fynw5W7PzjbnRyxnfMsID2 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
       "source": "test-system", 
       "eventName": "suspicious_login",
       "severity": "high",
       "user": "test-user-2",
       "srcIP": "192.168.1.100",
       "action": "login_attempt",
       "result": "success"
     }'
   ```

4. **Wait 5 minutes, then compare the signal results:**
   ```sql copy
   -- View signals for the detection
   SELECT detectionName,
          severity,
          recordsReturned,
          categories,
          receivedAt,
          results as raw_results
   FROM signals 
   WHERE detectionName = 'test-suspicious-login'
   ORDER BY receivedAt DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   ![SQL Signal Query](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-sql-signal.png)

5. **To the alerts results:**
   ```sql copy
   -- View alerts for the detection
   SELECT detectionName,
          severity,
          recordsReturned, 
          id,
          receivedAt,
          -- Extract user from results (simplified)
          results as raw_results
   FROM alerts
   WHERE detectionName = 'test-suspicious-login'
   ORDER BY receivedAt DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   ![SQL Alert Query](/alerts-detections-signals-guide-sql-alert.png)

6. **Compare in RunReveal UI:**
   - Navigate to the **[Alerts page](https://app.runreveal.com/dash/alerts)** in RunReveal UI
   - Use the dropdown filter to switch between **All**, **Alerts**, and **Signals**
   - Compare the results:
     - **Signals**: Shows detection results without notifications
     - **Alerts**: Shows detection results that triggered notifications
     - **All**: Shows both signals and alerts together

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Start with Signals** → Validate detection logic without noise
2. **Tune the rule** → Adjust query logic and thresholds  
3. **Convert to Alert** → Add notifications when ready for production
4. **Monitor performance** → Track execution times and match rates
