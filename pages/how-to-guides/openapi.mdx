# OpenAPI Specification 

RunReveal provides an OpenAPI 3.0 specification that can be retrieved in two ways:

## Method 1: Using the CLI Command

Generate the OpenAPI specification to a local JSON file using the RunReveal CLI:

```bash
# Generate spec to default file (runreveal-openapi.json)
runreveal openapi

# Generate spec to custom file
runreveal openapi --output api-spec.json
runreveal openapi -o /path/to/custom-spec.json
```

Read [instructions on how to use the CLI here](../reference/using-the-cli).

## Method 2: HTTP Endpoint (Runtime)

Retrieve the specification dynamically from a running RunReveal instance. The token you use needs `Workspace Read` [permissions](../reference/role-based-access-control):

```bash
# Get spec from live environment
curl -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://api.runreveal.com/openapi

# Get spec from custom environment
curl -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://your-custom-domain.com/openapi
```

The OpenAPI specification enables easier integration with RunReveal and more reliable API usage:

- **API Documentation**: Import into Swagger UI, Postman, or similar tools
- **Client Generation**: Use with OpenAPI generators for various languages
- **API Testing**: Validate requests and responses against the schema
- **Integration**: Understand available endpoints and authentication requirements

## Authentication

When accessing via HTTP endpoint, include your RunReveal API token in the Authorization header as shown in the examples above.
