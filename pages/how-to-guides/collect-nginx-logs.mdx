# Collect Nginx Logs

[Reveald](https://github.com/runreveal/reveald) is an easy-to-use, performant,
efficient, and open source log and event collection daemon for endpoint
collection.

We can use reveald to collect nginx logs to be visualized in RunReveal.  In this
guide, we'll install, configure and run reveald on the machine running nginx (or
a host that is visible on the network from the host running nginx).

First, download a reveald release for the operating system and architecture of
the host you'll be running the daemon on from the releases page
[here](https://github.com/runreveal/reveald/releases).
([https://github.com/runreveal/reveald/releases](https://github.com/runreveal/reveald/releases))
Extract the package to a directory of your choosing on the host.

Next, login to RunReveal and create a [structured
webhook](/Sources/Webhook-Sources/Structured-Webhooks) source.  This will give
us a webhookURL needed to configure a destination in reveald to send our data to
runreveal.  You can create a source directly using [this
link](https://runreveal.com/dash/sources/add/structured-webhook)

Here is a sample configuration for the syslog listener for which we'll be
sending our logs.  Replace `{{YOUR-RUNREVEAL-WEBHOOKURL}}` with the webhook
received from the UI in the step above.

```
{
  "sources": {
    "nginx-logs": {
        "type": "nginx_syslog",
        "addr": "127.0.0.1:5514",
    },
  },
  "destinations": {
    "rr-dest": {
      "type": "runreveal",
      "webhookURL": "{{YOUR-RUNREVEAL-WEBHOOKURL}}",
    },
  },
}
```

We can run reveald pointing at the configuration like so (assuming you download
it to the same directory as the binary).

```
./reveald run --config=./config.json
```

Now, add this `access_log` line to the `server` block for the sites that you
wish to receive access logs from.  If you're not running reveald on the same
host as nginx, replace the localhost address `127.0.0.1` with the host IP you've
configured reveald to listen on.

```
server {
    access_log syslog:server=127.0.0.1:5514 combined;
    # ... other config ...
}
```

Test your nginx config and reload the nginx process:

```
sudo nginx -s reload
```

You should now be getting logs in your RunReveal workspace!  Let's run some
queries on RunReveal once you've gotten some traffic to the site you've
configured.
